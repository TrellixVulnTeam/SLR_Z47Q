2,2019.0,Sofware engneering challenges for machine learning applications: A literature review,"Kumeno, F","Machine learning techniques, especially deep learning, have achieved remarkable breakthroughs over the past decade. At present, machine learning applications are deployed in many fields. However, the outcomes of software engineering researches are not always easily utilized in the development and deployment of machine learning applications. The main reason for this difficulty is the many differences between machine learning applications and traditional information systems. Machine learning techniques are evolving rapidly, but face inherent technical and non-technical challenges that complicate their lifecycle activities. This review paper attempts to clarify the software engineering challenges for machine learning applications that either exist or potentially exist by conducting a systematic literature collection and by mapping the identified challenge topics to knowledge areas defined by the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (Swebok).",4

6,2019.0,Literature review: Machine learning techniques applied to financial market prediction,"Henrique, BM; Sobreiro, VA; Kimura, H","The search for models to predict the prices of financial markets is still a highly researched topic, despite major related challenges. The prices of financial assets are non-linear, dynamic, and chaotic; thus, they are financial time series that are difficult to predict. Among the latest techniques, machine learning models are some of the most researched, given their capabilities for recognizing complex patterns in various applications. With the high productivity in the machine learning area applied to the prediction of financial market prices, objective methods are required for a consistent analysis of the most relevant bibliography on the subject. This article proposes the use of bibliographic survey techniques that highlight the most important texts for an area of research. Specifically, these techniques are applied to the literature about machine learning for predicting financial market values, resulting in a bibliographical review of the most important studies about this topic. Fifty-seven texts were reviewed, and a classification was proposed for markets, assets, methods, and variables. Among the main results, of particular note is the greater number of studies that use data from the North American market The most commonly used models for prediction involve support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks. It was concluded that the research theme is still relevant and that the use of data from developing markets is a research opportunity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1

9,2019.0,Machine learning techniques for code smell detection: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis,"Azeem, MI; Palomba, F; Shi, L; Wang, Q","Background: Code smells indicate suboptimal design or implementation choices in the source code that often lead it to be more change- and fault-prone. Researchers defined dozens of code smell detectors, which exploit different sources of information to support developers when diagnosing design flaws. Despite their good accuracy, previous work pointed out three important limitations that might preclude the use of code smell detectors in practice: (i) subjectiveness of developers with respect to code smells detected by such tools, (ii) scarce agreement between different detectors, and (iii) difficulties in finding good thresholds to be used for detection. To overcome these limitations, the use of machine learning techniques represents an ever increasing research area. Objective: While the research community carefully studied the methodologies applied by researchers when defining heuristic-based code smell detectors, there is still a noticeable lack of knowledge on how machine learning approaches have been adopted for code smell detection and whether there are points of improvement to allow a better detection of code smells. Our goal is to provide an overview and discuss the usage of machine learning approaches in the field of code smells. Method: This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on Machine Learning Techniques for Code Smell Detection. Our work considers papers published between 2000 and 2017. Starting from an initial set of 2456 papers, we found that 15 of them actually adopted machine learning approaches. We studied them under four different perspectives: (i) code smells considered, (ii) setup of machine learning approaches, (iii) design of the evaluation strategies, and (iv) a meta-analysis on the performance achieved by the models proposed so far. Results: The analyses performed show that God Class, Long Method, Functional Decomposition, and Spaghetti Code have been heavily considered in the literature. DECISION TREES and SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES are the most commonly used machine learning algorithms for code smell detection. Models based on a large set of independent variables have performed well. JRIP and RANDOM FOREST are the most effective classifiers in terms of performance. The analyses also reveal the existence of several open issues and challenges that the research community should focus on in the future. Conclusion: Based on our findings, we argue that there is still room for the improvement of machine learning techniques in the context of code smell detection. The open issues emerged in this study can represent the input for researchers interested in developing more powerful techniques.",1

11,2021.0,Machine Learning for industrial applications: A comprehensive literature review,"Bertolini, M; Mezzogori, D; Neroni, M; Zammori, F","Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that studies algorithms able to learn autonomously, directly from the input data. Over the last decade, ML techniques have made a huge leap forward, as demonstrated by Deep Learning (DL) algorithms implemented by autonomous driving cars, or by electronic strategy games. Hence, researchers have started to consider ML also for applications within the industrial field, and many works indicate ML as one the main enablers to evolve a traditional manufacturing system up to the Industry 4.0 level. Nonetheless, industrial applications are still few and limited to a small cluster of international companies. This paper deals with these topics, intending to clarify the real potentialities, as well as potential flaws, of ML algorithms applied to operation management. A comprehensive review is presented and organized in a way that should facilitate the orientation of practitioners in this field. To this aim, papers from 2000 to date are categorized in terms of the applied algorithm and application domain, and a keyword analysis is also performed, to details the most promising topics in the field. What emerges is a consistent upward trend in the number of publications, with a spike of interest for unsupervised and especially deep learning techniques, which recorded a very high number of publications in the last five years. Concerning trends, along with consolidated research areas, recent topics that are growing in popularity were also discovered. Among these, the main ones are production planning and control and defect analysis, thus suggesting that in the years to come ML will become pervasive in many fields of operation management.",4
12,2020.0,Utilizing crowdsourcing and machine learning in education: Literature review,"Alenezi, HS; Faisal, MH","For many years, learning continues to be a vital developing field since it is the key measure of the world's civilization and evolution with its enormous effect on both individuals and societies. Enhancing existing learning activities in general will have a significant impact on literacy rates around the world. One of the crucial activities in education is the assessment method because it is the primary way used to evaluate the student during their studies. The main purpose of this review is to examine the existing learning and e-learning approaches that use either crowdsourcing, machine learning, or both crowdsourcing and machine learning in their proposed solutions. This review will also investigate the addressed applications to identify the existing researches related to the assessment. Identifying all existing applications will assist in finding the unexplored gaps and limitations. This study presents a systematic literature review investigating 30 papers from the following databases: IEEE and ACM Digital Library. After performing the analysis, we found that crowdsourcing is utilized in 47.8% of the investigated learning activities, while each of the machine learning and the hybrid solutions are utilized in 26% of the investigated learning activities. Furthermore, all the existing approaches regarding the exam assessment problem that are using machine learning or crowdsourcing were identified. Some of the existing assessment systems are using the crowdsourcing approach and other systems are using the machine learning, however, none of the approaches provide a hybrid assessment system that uses both crowdsourcing and machine learning. Finally, it is found that using either crowdsourcing or machine learning in the online courses will enhance the interactions between the students. It is concluded that the current learning activities need to be enhanced since it is directly affecting the student's performance. Moreover, merging both the machine learning to the crowd wisdom will increase the accuracy and the efficiency of education.",4

15,2020.0,A Systematic Literature Review on Machine Learning for Automated Requirements Classification,"Perez-Verdejo, JM; Sanchez-Garcia, AJ; Ocharan-Hernandez, JO","The development of quality software begins with the correct identification of the system needs. These requirements represent the basis of the subsequent activities in the software life cycle. The correct identification of these requirements in their different categories impacts on the actions taken to meet them. However, this classification can be often time-consuming or error-prone when it comes to large-scale systems, so different proposals have been made to assist in this process automatically. This systematic literature review identifies those applications of Machine Learning techniques in the classification of software requirements. In this regard, 13 articles were identified, from which relevant information on the applied algorithms, their training process, and their evaluation metrics are analyzed.

16,2012.0,Systematic literature review of machine learning based software development effort estimation models,"Wen, JF; Li, SX; Lin, ZY; Hu, Y; Huang, CQ","Context: Software development effort estimation (SDEE) is the process of predicting the effort required to develop a software system. In order to improve estimation accuracy, many researchers have proposed machine learning (ML) based SDEE models (ML models) since 1990s. However, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way. Objective: This research aims to systematically analyze ML models from four aspects: type of ML technique, estimation accuracy, model comparison, and estimation context. Method: We performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies on ML model published in the last two decades (1991-2010). Results: We have identified 84 primary studies relevant to the objective of this research. After investigating these studies, we found that eight types of ML techniques have been employed in SDEE models. Overall speaking, the estimation accuracy of these ML models is close to the acceptable level and is better than that of non-ML models. Furthermore, different ML models have different strengths and weaknesses and thus favor different estimation contexts. Conclusion: ML models are promising in the field of SDEE. However, the application of ML models in industry is still limited, so that more effort and incentives are needed to facilitate the application of ML models. To this end, based on the findings of this review, we provide recommendations for researchers as well as guidelines for practitioners. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",4
17,2019.0,Machine Learning in Banking Risk Management: A Literature Review,"Leo, M; Sharma, S; Maddulety, K","There is an increasing influence of machine learning in business applications, with many solutions already implemented and many more being explored. Since the global financial crisis, risk management in banks has gained more prominence, and there has been a constant focus around how risks are being detected, measured, reported and managed. Considerable research in academia and industry has focused on the developments in banking and risk management and the current and emerging challenges. This paper, through a review of the available literature seeks to analyse and evaluate machine-learning techniques that have been researched in the context of banking risk management, and to identify areas or problems in risk management that have been inadequately explored and are potential areas for further research. The review has shown that the application of machine learning in the management of banking risks such as credit risk, market risk, operational risk and liquidity risk has been explored; however, it doesn't appear commensurate with the current industry level of focus on both risk management and machine learning. A large number of areas remain in bank risk management that could significantly benefit from the study of how machine learning can be applied to address specific problems.",1
18,2020.0,Corporate Default Predictions Using Machine Learning: Literature Review,"Kim, H; Cho, H; Ryu, D","Corporate default predictions play an essential role in each sector of the economy, as highlighted by the global financial crisis and the increase in credit risk. This study reviews the corporate default prediction literature from the perspectives of financial engineering and machine learning. We define three generations of statistical models: discriminant analyses, binary response models, and hazard models. In addition, we introduce three representative machine learning methodologies: support vector machines, decision trees, and artificial neural network algorithms. For both the statistical models and machine learning methodologies, we identify the key studies used in corporate default prediction. By comparing these methods with findings from the interdisciplinary literature, our review suggests some new tasks in the field of machine learning for predicting corporate defaults. First, a corporate default prediction model should be a multi-period model in which future outcomes are affected by past decisions. Second, the stock price and the corporate value determined by the stock market are important factors to use in default predictions. Finally, a corporate default prediction model should be able to suggest the cause of default.",1
19,2020.0,A systematic literature review of machine learning techniques for software maintainability prediction,"Alsolai, H; Roper, M","Context: Software maintainability is one of the fundamental quality attributes of software engineering. The accurate prediction of software maintainability is a significant challenge for the effective management of the software maintenance process. Objective: The major aim of this paper is to present a systematic review of studies related to the prediction of maintainability of object-oriented software systems using machine learning techniques. This review identifies and investigates a number of research questions to comprehensively summarize, analyse and discuss various viewpoints concerning software maintainability measurements, metrics, datasets, evaluation measures, individual models and ensemble models. Method: The review uses the standard systematic literature review method applied to the most common computer science digital database libraries from January 1991 to July 2018. Results: We survey 56 relevant studies in 35 journals and 21 conference proceedings. The results indicate that there is relatively little activity in the area of software maintainability prediction compared with other software quality attributes. CHANGE maintenance effort and the maintainability index were the most commonly used software measurements (dependent variables) employed in the selected primary studies, and most made use of class-level product metrics as the independent variables. Several private datasets were used in the selected studies, and there is a growing demand to publish datasets publicly. Most studies focused on regression problems and performed k-fold cross-validation. Individual prediction models were employed in the majority of studies, while ensemble models relatively rarely. Conclusion: Based on the findings obtained in this systematic literature review, ensemble models demonstrated increased accuracy prediction over individual models, and have been shown to be useful models in predicting software maintainability. However, their application is relatively rare and there is a need to apply these, and other models to an extensive variety of datasets with the aim of improving the accuracy and consistency of results.",4

25,2021.0,Application of machine learning to improve dairy farm management: A systematic literature review,"Slob, N; Catal, C; Kassahun, A","In recent years, several researchers and practitioners applied machine learning algorithms in the dairy farm context and discussed several solutions to predict various variables of interest, most of which were related to incipient diseases. The objective of this article is to identify, assess, and synthesize the papers that discuss the application of machine learning in the dairy farm management context. Using a systematic literature review (SLR) protocol, we retrieved 427 papers, of which 38 papers were determined as primary studies and thus were analysed in detail. More than half of the papers (55 %) addressed disease detection. The other two categories of problems addressed were milk production and milk quality. Seventy-one independent variables were identified and grouped into seven categories. The two prominent categories that were used in more than half of the papers were milking parameters and milk properties. The other categories of independent variables were milk content, pregnancy/calving information, cow characteristics, lactation, and farm characteristics. Twenty-three algorithms were identified, which we grouped into four categories. Decision tree-based algorithms are by far the most used followed by artificial neural network-based algorithms. Regression-based algorithms and other algorithms that do not belong to the previous categories were used in 13 papers. Twenty-three evaluation parameters were identified of which 7 were used 3 or more times. The three evaluation parameters that were used by more than half of the papers are sensitivity, specificity, RMSE. The challenges most encountered were feature selection and unbalanced data and together with problem size, overfitting/estimating, and parameter tuning account for three-quarters of the challenges identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLR study on the use of machine learning to improve dairy farm management, and to this end, this study will be valuable not only for researchers but also practitioners in dairy farms.",1

Results: Our literature search identified 8 interventions incorporating machine learning in a real-life research setting, of which 3 (37%) were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and 5 (63%) in a pilot or experimental single-group study. The interventions targeted depression prediction and management, speech recognition for people with speech disabilities, self-efficacy for weight loss, detection of changes in biopsychosocial condition of patients with multiple morbidity, stress management, treatment of phantom limb pain, smoking cessation, and personalized nutrition based on glycemic response. The average number of enrolled participants in the studies was 71 (range 8-214), and the average follow-up study duration was 69 days (range 3-180). Of the 8 interventions, 6 (75%) showed statistical significance (at the P=.05 level) in health outcomes. Conclusions: This review found that digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms in real-life studies can be useful and effective. Given the low number of studies identified in this review and that they did not follow a rigorous machine learning evaluation methodology, we urge the research community to conduct further studies in intervention settings following evaluation principles and demonstrating the potential of machine learning in clinical practice.",1
27,2015.0,A systematic review of machine learning techniques for software fault prediction,"Malhotra, R","Background: Software fault prediction is the process of developing models that can be used by the software practitioners in the early phases of software development life cycle for detecting faulty constructs such as modules or classes. There are various machine learning techniques used in the past for predicting faults. Method: In this study we perform a systematic review of studies from January 1991 to October 2013 in the literature that use the machine learning techniques for software fault prediction. We assess the performance capability of the machine learning techniques in existing research for software fault prediction. We also compare the performance of the machine learning techniques with the statistical techniques and other machine learning techniques. Further the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning techniques are summarized. Results: In this paper we have identified 64 primary studies and seven categories of the machine learning techniques. The results prove the prediction capability of the machine learning techniques for classifying module/class as fault prone or not fault prone. The models using the machine learning techniques for estimating software fault proneness outperform the traditional statistical models. Conclusion: Based on the results obtained from the systematic review, we conclude that the machine learning techniques have the ability for predicting software fault proneness and can be used by software practitioners and researchers. However, the application of the machine learning techniques in software fault prediction is still limited and more number of studies should be carried out in order to obtain well formed and generalizable results. We provide future guidelines to practitioners and researchers based on the results obtained in this work. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
28,2018.0,The use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems: A systematic review,"Portugal, I; Alencar, P; Cowan, D","Recommender systems use algorithms to provide users with product or service recommendations. Recently, these systems have been using machine learning algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a recommender system is difficult because of the number of algorithms described in the literature. Researchers and practitioners developing recommender systems are left with little information about the current approaches in algorithm usage. Moreover, the development of recommender systems using machine learning algorithms often faces problems and raises questions that must be resolved. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies new research opportunities. The goals of this study are to (i) identify trends in the use or research of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems; (ii) identify open questions in the use or research of machine learning algorithms; and (iii) assist new researchers to position new research activity in this domain appropriately. The results of this study identify existing classes of recommender systems, characterize adopted machine learning approaches, discuss the use of big data technologies, identify types of machine learning algorithms and their application domains, and analyzes both main and alternative performance metrics.

30,2020.0,Machine Learning Models for Automatic Labeling: A Systematic Literature Review,"Fredriksson, T; Bosch, J; Olsson, H","Automatic labeling is a type of classification problem. Classification has been studied with the help of statistical methods for a long time. With the explosion of new better computer processing units (CPUs) and graphical processing units (GPUs) the interest in machine learning has grown exponentially and we can use both statistical learning algorithms as well as deep neural networks (DNNs) to solve the classification tasks. Classification is a supervised machine learning problem and there exists a large amount of methodology for performing such task. However, it is very rare in industrial applications that data is fully labeled which is why we need good methodology to obtain error-free labels. The purpose of this paper is to examine the current literature on how to perform labeling using ML, we will compare these models in terms of popularity and on what datatypes they are used on. We performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies for machine learning for labeling. We identified 43 primary studies relevant to our search. From this we were able to determine the most common machine learning models for labeling. Lack of unlabeled instances is a major problem for industry as supervised learning is the most widely used. Obtaining labels is costly in terms of labor and financial costs. Based on our findings in this review we present alternate ways for labeling data for use in supervised learning tasks.",0
31,2020.0,Statistical and machine learning models in credit scoring: A systematic literature survey,"Dastile, X; Celik, T; Potsane, M","In practice, as a well-known statistical method, the logistic regression model is used to evaluate the credit-worthiness of borrowers due to its simplicity and transparency in predictions. However, in literature, sophisticated machine learning models can be found that can replace the logistic regression model. Despite the advances and applications of machine learning models in credit scoring, there are still two major issues: the incapability of some of the machine learning models to explain predictions; and the issue of imbalanced datasets. As such, there is a need for a thorough survey of recent literature in credit scoring. This article employs a systematic literature survey approach to systematically review statistical and machine learning models in credit scoring, to identify limitations in literature, to propose a guiding machine learning framework, and to point to emerging directions. This literature survey is based on 74 primary studies, such as journal and conference articles, that were published between 2010 and 2018. According to the meta-analysis of this literature survey, we found that in general, an ensemble of classifiers performs better than single classifiers. Although deep learning models have not been applied extensively in credit scoring literature, they show promising results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1

In addition, there is increasing adoption of third-party cloud services for outsourcing training of DL models, which requires substantial costly computational resources (e.g., high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs)). Such widespread usage of cloud-hosted ML/DL services opens a wide range of attack surfaces for adversaries to exploit the ML/DL system to achieve malicious goals. In this article, we conduct a systematic evaluation of literature of cloud-hosted ML/DL models along both the important dimensions-attacks and defenses-related to their security. Our systematic review identified a total of 31 related articles out of which 19 focused on attack, six focused on defense, and six focused on both attack and defense.

34,2019.0,Machine Learning for Hardware Trojan Detection: A Review,"Liakos, KG; Georgakilas, GK; Moustakidis, S; Karlsson, P; Plessas, FC","Every year, the rate at which technology is applied on areas of our everyday life is increasing at a steady pace. This rapid development drives the technology companies to design and fabricate their integrated circuits (ICs) in non-trustworthy outsourcing foundries in order to reduce the cost. Thus, a synchronous form of virus, known as Hardware Trojans (HTs), was developed. HTs leak encrypted information, degrade device performance or lead to total destruction. To reduce the risks associated with these viruses, various approaches have been developed aiming to prevent and detect them, based on conventional or machine learning methods. Ideally, any undesired modification made to an IC should be detectable by pre-silicon verification/simulation and post-silicon testing. The infected circuit can be inserted in different stages of the manufacturing process, rendering the detection of HTs a complicated procedure. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of research dedicated to applications based on Machine Learning for the detection of HTs in ICs. The literature is categorized in (a) reverse- engineering development for the imaging phase, (b) real-time detection, (c) golden model-free approaches, (d) detection based on gate-level netlists features and (e) classification approaches.",3
35,2020.0,Machine learning applied to road safety modeling: A systematic literature review,"Silva, PB; Andrade, M; Ferreira, S","Road safety modeling is a valuable strategy for promoting safe mobility, enabling the development of crash prediction models (CPM) and the investigation of factors contributing to crash occurrence. This modeling has traditionally used statistical techniques despite acknowledging the limitations of this kind of approach (specific assumptions and prior definition of the link functions), which provides an opportunity to explore alternatives such as the use of machine learning (ML) techniques. This study reviews papers that used ML techniques for the development of CPM. A systematic literature review protocol was conducted, that resulted in the analysis of papers and their systematization. Three types of models were identified: crash frequency, crash classification by severity, and crash frequency and severity. The first is a regression problem, the second, a classificatory one and the third can be approached either as a combination of the preceding two or as a regression model for the expected number of crashes by severity levels. The main groups of techniques used for these purposes are nearest neighbor classification, decision trees, evolutionary algorithms, support-vector machine, and artificial neural networks. The last one is used in many kinds of approaches given the ability to deal with both regression and classification problems, and also multivariate response models. This paper also presents the main performance metrics used to evaluate the models and compares the results, showing the clear superiority of the ML-based models over the statistical ones. In addition, it identifies the main explanatory variables used in the models, which shows the predominance of road-environmental aspects as the most important factors contributing to crash occurrence. The review fulfilled its objective, identifying the various approaches and the main research characteristics, limitations, and opportunities, and also highlighting the potential of the usage of ML in crash analyses.

40,2021.0,Learning software configuration spaces: A systematic literature review,"Pereira, JA; Acher, M; Martin, H; Jezequel, JM; Botterweck, G; Ventresque, A","Most modern software systems (operating systems like Linux or Android, Web browsers like Firefox or Chrome, video encoders like ffmpeg, x264 or VLC, mobile and cloud applications, etc.) are highly configurable. Hundreds of configuration options, features, or plugins can be combined, each potentially with distinct functionality and effects on execution time, security, energy consumption, etc. Due to the combinatorial explosion and the cost of executing software, it is quickly impossible to exhaustively explore the whole configuration space. Hence, numerous works have investigated the idea of learning it from a small sample of configurations' measurements. The pattern sampling, measuring, learning has emerged in the literature, with several practical interests for both software developers and end-users of configurable systems. In this systematic literature review, we report on the different application objectives (e.g., performance prediction, configuration optimization, constraint mining), use-cases, targeted software systems, and application domains. We review the various strategies employed to gather a representative and cost-effective sample. We describe automated software techniques used to measure functional and non-functional properties of configurations. We classify machine learning algorithms and how they relate to the pursued application. Finally, we also describe how researchers evaluate the quality of the learning process. The findings from this systematic review show that the potential application objective is important; there are a vast number of case studies reported in the literature related to particular domains or software systems. Yet, the huge variant space of configurable systems is still challenging and calls to further investigate the synergies between artificial intelligence and software engineering.

The testing stage in the software development life cycle is expensive and consumes the most resources of all the stages. SDP can minimize the cost of the testing stage, which can ultimately lead to the development of higher-quality software at a lower cost. With this approach, only those modules classified as defective are tested. Over the past two decades, many researchers have proposed methods and frameworks to improve the performance of the SDP process. The main research topics are association, estimation, clustering, classification, and dataset analysis. This study provides a systematic literature review that highlights the latest research trends in the area of SDP by providing a critical review of papers published between 2016 and 2019. Initially, 1012 papers were shortlisted from three online libraries (IEEE Xplore, ACM, and ScienceDirect); following a systematic research protocol, 22 of these papers were selected for detailed critical review.

42,2021.0,Early Prediction of Sepsis in the ICU Using Machine Learning: A Systematic Review,"Moor, M; Rieck, B; Horn, M; Jutzeler, CR; Borgwardt, K","Background: Sepsis is among the leading causes of death in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide and its recognition, particularly in the early stages of the disease, remains a medical challenge. The advent of an affluence of available digital health data has created a setting in which machine learning can be used for digital biomarker discovery, with the ultimate goal to advance the early recognition of sepsis. Objective: To systematically review and evaluate studies employing machine learning for the prediction of sepsis in the ICU. Data Sources: Using Embase, Google Scholar, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science, we systematically searched the existing literature for machine learning-driven sepsis onset prediction for patients in the ICU. Study Eligibility Criteria: All peer-reviewed articles using machine learning for the prediction of sepsis onset in adult ICU patients were included. Studies focusing on patient populations outside the ICU were excluded. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Moreover, a quality assessment of all eligible studies was performed. Results: Out of 974 identified articles, 22 and 21 met the criteria to be included in the systematic review and quality assessment, respectively. A multitude of machine learning algorithms were applied to refine the early prediction of sepsis. The quality of the studies ranged from poor (satisfying <= 40% of the quality criteria) to very good (satisfying >= 90% of the quality criteria). The majority of the studies (n = 19, 86.4%) employed an offline training scenario combined with a horizon evaluation, while two studies implemented an online scenario (n = 2, 9.1%). The massive inter-study heterogeneity in terms of model development, sepsis definition, prediction time windows, and outcomes precluded a meta-analysis. Last, only two studies provided publicly accessible source code and data sources fostering reproducibility. Limitations: Articles were only eligible for inclusion when employing machine learning algorithms for the prediction of sepsis onset in the ICU. This restriction led to the exclusion of studies focusing on the prediction of septic shock, sepsis-related mortality, and patient populations outside the ICU. Conclusions and Key Findings: A growing number of studies employs machine learning to optimize the early prediction of sepsis through digital biomarker discovery. This review, however, highlights several shortcomings of the current approaches, including low comparability and reproducibility. Finally, we gather recommendations how these challenges can be addressed before deploying these models in prospective analyses. Systematic Review Registration Number: CRD42020200133.",1

Early prediction and decision-making are key factors to control dengue. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) analyzes three modeling approaches of dengue: diagnostic, epidemic, intervention. These approaches require models of prediction, prescription and optimization. This SLR establishes the state-of-the-art in dengue modeling, using machine learning, in the last years. Methods: Several databases were selected to search the articles. The selection was made based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Sixty-four articles were obtained and analyzed to describe their strengths and limitations. Finally, challenges and opportunities for research on machine-learning for dengue modeling were identified. Results: Logistic regression was the most used modeling approach for the diagnosis of dengue (59.1%). The analysis of the epidemic approach showed that linear regression (17.4%) is the most used technique within the spatial analysis. Finally, the most used intervention modeling is General Linear Model with 70%. Conclusions: We conclude that cause-effect models may improve diagnosis and understanding of dengue. Models that manage uncertainty can also be helpful, because of low data-quality in healthcare. Finally, decentralization of data, using federated learning, may decrease computational costs and allow model building without compromising data security.",1

They tend to have a negative impact on software quality. Several studies use machine learning techniques to detect bad smells. The objective of this study is to systematically review and analyze machine learning techniques used to detect code smells to provide interested research community with knowledge about the adopted techniques and practices for code smells detection. We use a systematic literature review approach to review studies that use machine learning techniques to detect code smells. Seventeen primary studies were identified. We found that 27 code smells were used in the identified studies; God Class and Long Method, Feature Envy, and Data Class are the most frequently detected code smells. In addition, we found that 16 machine learning algorithms were employed to detect code smells with acceptable prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we the results also indicate that support vector machine techniques were investigated the most. Moreover, we observed that J48 and Random Forest algorithms outperform the other algorithms. We also noticed that, in some cases, the use of boosting techniques on the models does not always enhance their performance. More studies are needed to consider the use of ensemble learning techniques, multiclassification, and feature selection technique for code smells detection. Thus, the application of machine learning algorithms to detect code smells in systems is still in its infancy and needs more research to facilitate the employment of machine learning algorithms in detecting code smells.",1
49,2021.0,Iterative guided machine learning-assisted systematic literature reviews: a diabetes case study,"Zimmerman, J; Soler, RE; Lavinder, J; Murphy, S; Atkins, C; Hulbert, L; Lusk, R; Ng, BP","Background Systematic Reviews (SR), studies of studies, use a formal process to evaluate the quality of scientific literature and determine ensuing effectiveness from qualifying articles to establish consensus findings around a hypothesis. Their value is increasing as the conduct and publication of research and evaluation has expanded and the process of identifying key insights becomes more time consuming. Text analytics and machine learning (ML) techniques may help overcome this problem of scale while still maintaining the level of rigor expected of SRs. Methods In this article, we discuss an approach that uses existing examples of SRs to build and test a method for assisting the SR title and abstract pre-screening by reducing the initial pool of potential articles down to articles that meet inclusion criteria. Our approach differs from previous approaches to using ML as a SR tool in that it incorporates ML configurations guided by previously conducted SRs, and human confirmation on ML predictions of relevant articles during multiple iterative reviews on smaller tranches of citations. We applied the tailored method to a new SR review effort to validate performance. Results The case study test of the approach proved a sensitivity (recall) in finding relevant articles during down selection that may rival many traditional processes and show ability to overcome most type II errors. The study achieved a sensitivity of 99.5% (213 out of 214) of total relevant articles while only conducting a human review of 31% of total articles available for review. Conclusions We believe this iterative method can help overcome bias in initial ML model training by having humans reinforce ML models with new and relevant information, and is an applied step towards transfer learning for ML in SR.",3

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has been developed to overcome the communication barriers between humans and computers. One form of HCI is Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR), which predicts the class and the instant of execution of a given movement of the hand. One possible input for these models is surface electromyography (EMG), which records the electrical activity of skeletal muscles. EMG signals contain information about the intention of movement generated by the human brain. This systematic literature review analyses the state-of-the-art of real-time hand gesture recognition models using EMG data and machine learning. We selected and assessed 65 primary studies following the Kitchenham methodology. Based on a common structure of machine learning-based systems, we analyzed the structure of the proposed models and standardized concepts in regard to the types of models, data acquisition, segmentation, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, postprocessing, real-time processing, types of gestures, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we also identified trends and gaps that could open new directions of work for future research in the area of gesture recognition using EMG.",4

Numerous machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied in medical information systems. These can significantly contribute to the decision-making process, such as diagnosis, prediction, and exploring the benefits of clinical care. This study aims to determine insights into the current state of data mining applications employed by ML in the field of medical informatics (MI). We believe that this exploration would lead to many unrevealed answers in predictive modelling in medical informatics. A systematic search was performed in the most influential scientific electronic databases and one specific another database between 2016 to 2020 (April). Research questions are outlined after the researcher has studied previous research done on the subject. We identified 51 related samples out of 1224 searched articles that satisfied our inclusion criteria. There is a significant increasing pattern of ML application in MI. In addition, the most popular algorithm for classification problem is Support Vector Machine (SVM), followed by random forest (RF). In contrast, Accuracy and Specificity are the most commonly used mechanisms for performance indicators calculation.

However, the nature of UGC brings challenges in both data collecting and processing. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the effectiveness of applying machine learning (ML) methodologies to UGC for personal health investigations. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Library, ACM library, AAAI library, and the ACL anthology. We focused on research articles that were published in English and in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings between 2010 and 2018. Publications that applied ML to UGC with a focus on personal health were identified for further systematic review. Results: We identified 103 eligible studies which we summarized with respect to 5 research categories, 3 data collection strategies, 3 gold standard dataset creation methods, and 4 types of features applied in ML models. Popular off-the-shelf ML models were logistic regression (n=22), support vector machines (n=18), naive Bayes (n=17), ensemble learning (n=12), and deep learning (n=11). The most investigated problems were mental health (n=39) and cancer (n=15). Common health-related aspects extracted from UGC were treatment experience, sentiments and emotions, coping strategies, and social support. Conclusions: The systematic review indicated that ML can be effectively applied to UGC in facilitating the description and inference of personal health. Future research needs to focus on mitigating bias introduced when building study cohorts, creating features from free text, improving clinical creditability of UGC, and model interpretability.",1

How to deal with the conundrums has attracted a great deal of attention from both practitioners and researchers. This paper aims to synthesise research developments in the PR domain in order to provide an insightful picture of current research and explore future directions for the research community. To ensure research rigour, we adapt a six-step framework - defining the topic, searching databases, cleaning and clustering data, paper selection, content analysis, and discussion. A hybrid approach is adopted for clustering and identifying the distribution and themes in a large number of publications collected from academic databases. The hybrid approach combines machine learning topic modelling and bibliometric analysis. The machine learning results indicate that the overall research can be clustered into three groups: (1) operations management of PR, covering (re) manufacturing network design, product recovery, reverse distribution, and quality of cores; (2) retailer and (re) manufacturer issues including return policy, channel, inventory, pricing, and information strategies; and (3) customer's psychology, experience, and perception on marketing-operation interface. Furthermore, from the content analysis, five potential future directions are discussed, namely digitalisation in the context of PR; globalisation versus localisation in the context of PR; multi-layer (i.e., retailer, manufacturer, logistics provider, online platform) and multi-channel (i.e., online, offline, dual and omni channel) oriented bespoke return policy; understanding and predicting customer return behaviour via online footprints; and customer return perception across the marketing-operations interface.",2
58,2021.0,Machine Learning for the Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease: A Review of Literature,"Mei, J; Desrosiers, C; Frasnelli, J","Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly based on medical observations and assessment of clinical signs, including the characterization of a variety of motor symptoms. However, traditional diagnostic approaches may suffer from subjectivity as they rely on the evaluation of movements that are sometimes subtle to human eyes and therefore difficult to classify, leading to possible misclassification. In the meantime, early non-motor symptoms of PD may be mild and can be caused by many other conditions. Therefore, these symptoms are often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging. To address these difficulties and to refine the diagnosis and assessment procedures of PD, machine learning methods have been implemented for the classification of PD and healthy controls or patients with similar clinical presentations (e.g., movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes). To provide a comprehensive overview of data modalities and machine learning methods that have been used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD, in this study, we conducted a literature review of studies published until February 14, 2020, using the PubMed and IEEE Xplore databases. A total of 209 studies were included, extracted for relevant information and presented in this review, with an investigation of their aims, sources of data, types of data, machine learning methods and associated outcomes. These studies demonstrate a high potential for adaptation of machine learning methods and novel biomarkers in clinical decision making, leading to increasingly systematic, informed diagnosis of PD.",1
59,2020.0,Aligning text mining and machine learning algorithms with best practices for study selection in systematic literature reviews,"Popoff, E; Besada, M; Jansen, JP; Cope, S; Kanters, S","Background Despite existing research on text mining and machine learning for title and abstract screening, the role of machine learning within systematic literature reviews (SLRs) for health technology assessment (HTA) remains unclear given lack of extensive testing and of guidance from HTA agencies. We sought to address two knowledge gaps: to extend ML algorithms to provide a reason for exclusion-to align with current practices-and to determine optimal parameter settings for feature-set generation and ML algorithms. Methods We used abstract and full-text selection data from five large SLRs (n = 3089 to 12,769 abstracts) across a variety of disease areas. Each SLR was split into training and test sets. We developed a multi-step algorithm to categorize each citation into the following categories: included; excluded for each PICOS criterion; or unclassified. We used a bag-of-words approach for feature-set generation and compared machine learning algorithms using support vector machines (SVMs), naive Bayes (NB), and bagged classification and regression trees (CART) for classification. We also compared alternative training set strategies: using full data versus downsampling (i.e., reducing excludes to balance includes/excludes because machine learning algorithms perform better with balanced data), and using inclusion/exclusion decisions from abstract versus full-text screening. Performance comparisons were in terms of specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and matching the reason for exclusion. Results The best-fitting model (optimized sensitivity and specificity) was based on the SVM algorithm using training data based on full-text decisions, downsampling, and excluding words occurring fewer than five times. The sensitivity and specificity of this model ranged from 94 to 100%, and 54 to 89%, respectively, across the five SLRs. On average, 75% of excluded citations were excluded with a reason and 83% of these citations matched the reviewers' original reason for exclusion. Sensitivity significantly improved when both downsampling and abstract decisions were used. Conclusions ML algorithms can improve the efficiency of the SLR process and the proposed algorithms could reduce the workload of a second reviewer by identifying exclusions with a relevant PICOS reason, thus aligning with HTA guidance. Downsampling can be used to improve study selection, and improvements using full-text exclusions have implications for a learn-as-you-go approach.",3
60,2021.0,Intelligent cost estimation by machine learning in supply management: A structured literature review,"Bodendorf, F; Merkl, P; Franke, J","In the automotive industry, cost estimation of components to be purchased plays an important role for price negotiations with suppliers and, therefore, for cost control within the supply chain. While traditional bottom-up cost estimation is a very time consuming and know-how intensive process, intelligent machine learning methods have the potential to significantly reduce the effort in the cost estimation process. In this paper, a literature review on intelligent cost estimation methods for parts to be procured in the manufacturing industry is carried out by text mining. Following the results of this literature review, building blocks for an intelligent cost esti-mation system are outlined that comprise cost estimation methods, dimensionality reduction methods, methods for multi-level cost estimation, and methods for interpreting the results of the cost analysis. Regarding cost estimation methods , Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines outperform established linear regression algorithms. Dimensionality reduction methods like Correlation Analysis or Principal Component Analysis are rarely studied . Nevertheless, they contribute a lot to the reduction of expensively provided input parameters for cost estimation. Methods for multi-level cost estimation, that support cost prediction of parts and assemblies following the construction plan of a vehicle, and methods for interpretation of intelligent cost ana-lytics cannot be found at all in literature. Consequently, in this paper corresponding approaches are derived from the areas of Multitask Learning and Explainable Machine Learning. Finally, a combination of methods considered most suitable for predictive analytics to estimate procurement costs is presented.",3

As evident by Standish group chaos manifesto that approx. 43% of the projects are often delivered late and entered crises because of overbudget and less required functions. Improper and inaccurate estimation of software projects leads to a failure, and therefore it must be considered in true letter and spirit. When Agile principle-based process models (e.g., Scrum) came into the market, a significant change can be seen. This change in culture proves to be a boon for strengthening the collaboration between developer and customer. Estimation has always been challenging in Agile as requirements are volatile. This encourages researchers to work on effort estimation. There are many reasons for the gap between estimated and actual effort, viz., project, people, and resistance factors, wrong use of cost drivers, ignorance of regression testing effort, understandability of user story size and its associated complexity, etc. This paper reviewed the work of numerous authors and potential researchers working on bridging the gap of actual and estimated effort. Through intensive and literature review, it can be inferred that machine learning models clearly outperformed non-machine learning and traditional techniques of estimation.",4

For general object localization or classification tasks there do exist several giant databases containing several millions of labeled images and several thousands of different labels like COCO and ImageNet. In contrast in industrial applications like quality inspection there do hardly ever exist such training data not only for reasons of confidentiality of trade secrets. An obvious way to remedy this deficiency is the synthetic creation of image data. Physically based rendering attempts to achieve photorealistic images by accurately simulating the flow of light of the real world according to various physical laws. Therefor multiple techniques like Ray Tracing and Path Tracing have been implemented and are becoming increasingly widespread as hardware performance increases. The intent of this article is to give a wide but nevertheless preferably comprehensive overview of which approaches have been pursued in recent literature to generate realistic synthetic training images. The development of various rendering methods from rasterization to bidirectional monte carlo path tracing is outlined, as well as their differences and use. Along with the terminology a few mathematical foundations like the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) are briefly described.

74,2020.0,The application of machine learning techniques for driving behavior analysis: A conceptual framework and a systematic literature review,"Abou Elassad, ZE; Mousannif, H; Al Moatassime, H; Karkouch, A","Driving Behavior (DB) is a complex concept describing how the driver operates the vehicle in the context of the driving scene and surrounding environment. Recently, DB assessment has become an emerging topic of great importance. However, in view of to the stochastic nature of driving, measuring and modeling, DB continues to be a challenging topic today. As such, this paper argues that to move forward in understanding the individual and organizational mechanisms influencing DB, a conceptual framework is outlined whereby DB is viewed in terms of different dimensions established within the Driver-Vehicle-Environment (DVE) system. Moreover, DB assessment has been approached by various machine learning (ML) models. Still, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way, furthermore, ML based DB models often face problems and raise questions that must be resolved. This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of the DB investigation concept; In the first phase, a framework for conceptualizing a holistic approach of the different facets in DB analysis is presented, as well as a scheme to guide the future development and implementation of DB assessment strategies. In the second phase, an overview of the literature on ML is designed, revealing a premier and unbiased survey of the existing empirical research of ML techniques that have been applied to DB analysis. The results of this study identify an interpretive framework incorporating multiple dimensions influencing the driver's conduct, in an attempt to achieve a thorough understanding of the DB concept within the DVE system in which the drivers operate. Additionally, 82 primary studies published during the last decade and eight broadly used ML models were identified. The findings of this review prove the performance capability of the ML techniques for assessing DB. The models using the ML techniques outperform other conventional approaches. However, the application of ML models in DB analysis is still limited and more effort is needed to obtain well-formed and generalizable results. To this end, and based on the outcomes obtained in this work, future guidelines have been provided to practitioners and researchers to grasp the major contributions and challenges in the state-of-the-art research.",1

However, a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art on the use of machine learning in Precision Nutrition is lacking. Therefore, we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to provide an overview of where and how machine learning has been used in Precision Nutrition from various aspects, what such machine learning models use as input features, what the availability status of the data used in the literature is, and how the models are evaluated. Nine research questions were defined in this study. We retrieved 4930 papers from electronic databases and 60 primary studies were selected to respond to the research questions. All of the selected primary studies were also briefly discussed in this article. Our results show that fifteen problems spread across seven domains of nutrition and health are present. Four machine learning tasks are seen in the form of regression, classification, recommendation and clustering, with most of these utilizing a supervised approach. In total, 30 algorithms were used, with 19 appearing more than once. Models were through the use of four groups of approaches and 23 evaluation metrics. Personalized approaches are promising to reduce the burden of these current problems in nutrition research, and the current review shows Machine Learning can be incorporated into Precision Nutrition research with high performance.

Methods: Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol, 816 titles were identified from the PubMed, Scopus, and OvidSP databases. Studies that used machine learning to detect prostate cancer and provided performance measures were included in our analysis. The quality of the eligible studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 (quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-version 2) tool. The hierarchical multivariate model was applied to the pooled data in a meta-analysis. To investigate the heterogeneity among studies, I-2 statistics were performed along with visual evaluation of coupled forest plots. Due to the internal heterogeneity among machine learning algorithms, subgroup analysis was carried out to investigate the diagnostic capability of machine learning systems in clinical practice. Results: In the final analysis, 37 studies were included, of which 29 entered the meta-analysis pooling. The analysis of machine learning methods to detect prostate cancer reveals the limited usage of the methods and the lack of standards that hinder the implementation of machine learning in clinical applications. Conclusions: The performance of machine learning for diagnosis of prostate cancer was considered satisfactory for several studies investigating the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and urine biomarkers; however, given the limitations indicated in our study, further studies are warranted to extend the potential use of machine learning to clinical settings. Recommendations on the use of machine learning techniques were also provided to help researchers to design robust studies to facilitate evidence generation from the use of radiomic and genomic biomarkers.",1
78,2021.0,Machine Learning in Chronic Pain Research: A Scoping Review,"Jenssen, MDK; Bakkevoll, PA; Ngo, PD; Budrionis, A; Fagerlund, AJ; Tayefi, M; Bellika, JG; Godtliebsen, F","Given the high prevalence and associated cost of chronic pain, it has a significant impact on individuals and society. Improvements in the treatment and management of chronic pain may increase patients' quality of life and reduce societal costs. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in chronic pain research. A literature search was conducted using the PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library databases. Relevant studies were identified by screening titles and abstracts for keywords related to chronic pain and machine learning, followed by analysing full texts. Two hundred and eighty-seven publications were identified in the literature search. In total, fifty-three papers on chronic pain research and machine learning were reviewed. The review showed that while many studies have emphasised machine learning-based classification for the diagnosis of chronic pain, far less attention has been paid to the treatment and management of chronic pain. More research is needed on machine learning approaches to the treatment, rehabilitation, and self-management of chronic pain. As with other chronic conditions, patient involvement and self-management are crucial. In order to achieve this, patients with chronic pain need digital tools that can help them make decisions about their own treatment and care.",1
79,2020.0,Review of Machine Learning in Predicting Dermatological Outcomes,"Du, AX; Emam, S; Gniadecki, R","Artificial intelligence is a broad branch of computer science that has garnered significant interest in the field of medicine because of its problem solving, decision making and pattern recognition abilities. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, hones in on the ability of computers to receive data and learn for themselves, manipulating algorithms as they organize the information they are processing. Dermatology is at a particular advantage in the implementation of machine learning due to the availability of large clinical image databases that can be used for machine training and interpretation. While numerous studies have implemented machine learning in the diagnostic aspect of dermatology, less research has been conducted on the use of machine learning in predicting long-term outcomes in skin disease, with only a few studies published to date. Such an approach would assist physicians in selecting the best treatment methods, save patients' time, reduce treatment costs and improve the quality of treatment overall by reducing the amount of trial-and-error in the treatment process. In this review, we aim to provide a brief and relevant introduction to basic artificial intelligence processes, and to consolidate and examine the published literature on the use of machine learning in predicting clinical outcomes in dermatology.",1

Metagenomics, the field that studies the different genomes within these samples, is becoming increasingly popular, as it has many real-world applications, such as the discovery of new antibiotics, personalized medicine, forensics, and many more. From a computer science point of view, it is interesting to see how these large volumes of data can be processed efficiently to accurately identify (classify) the microorganisms from the input DNA data. This scoping review aims to give an insight into the existing state of the art computational methods for processing metagenomic data through the prism of machine learning, data science, and big data. We provide an overview of the state of the art metagenomic classification methods, as well as the challenges researchers face when tackling this complex problem. The end goal of this review is to help researchers be up to date with current trends, as well as identify opportunities for further research and improvements. Applied machine learning in bioinformatics is growing as computer science slowly invades all research spheres. With the arrival of modern next-generation DNA sequencing algorithms, metagenomics is becoming an increasingly interesting research field as it finds countless practical applications exploiting the vast amounts of generated data. This study aims to scope the scientific literature in the field of metagenomic classification in the time interval 2008-2019 and provide an evolutionary timeline of data processing and machine learning in this field. This study follows the scoping review methodology and PRISMA guidelines to identify and process the available literature. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is deployed to ensure efficient and exhaustive search of the literary corpus of three large digital libraries: IEEE, PubMed, and Springer. The search is based on keywords and properties looked up using the digital libraries' search engines. The scoping review results reveal an increasing number of research papers related to metagenomic classification over the past decade. The research is mainly focused on metagenomic classifiers, identifying scope specific metrics for model evaluation, data set sanitization, and dimensionality reduction. Out of all of these subproblems, data preprocessing is the least researched with considerable potential for improvement.",3
81,2017.0,Machine Learning Applications in Baseball: A Systematic Literature Review,"Koseler, K; Stephan, M","Statistical analysis of baseball has long been popular, albeit only in limited capacity until relatively recently. In particular, analysts can now apply machine learning algorithms to large baseball data sets to derive meaningful insights into player and team performance. In the interest of stimulating new research and serving as a go-to resource for academic and industrial analysts, we perform a systematic literature review of machine learning applications in baseball analytics. The approaches employed in literature fall mainly under three problem class umbrellas: Regression, Binary Classification, and Multiclass Classification. We categorize these approaches, provide our insights on possible future applications, and conclude with a summary of our findings. We find two algorithms dominate the literature: (1) Support Vector Machines for classification problems and (2) k-nearest neighbors for both classification and Regression problems. We postulate that recent proliferation of neural networks in general machine learning research will soon carry over into baseball analytics.",0

Several researchers focus on the theory of teamwork organizations, based on academic performances, learning styles, learning settings, gender, etc. Therefore, grouping learners based on their predicted academic performance level in each subject separately may be more effective in a collaborative learning environment, but it still a challenging subject. First of all, we present in this paper a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the relevant studies that address the problem of predicting academic performance and to extract the used data mining methods such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, etc. At the beginning, a set of 658 papers were selected. After applying the different SLR's steps, this selection has been filtered to 12 papers using specific selection criteria and a careful analysis of each paper. Then, the selected studies were used to answer the defined research questions. Finally, synthesis data, current research gaps and recommendations for further work are discussed in this paper.",1
83,2021.0,Convolutional Extreme Learning Machines: A Systematic Review,"Rodrigues, IR; Neto, SRD; Kelner, J; Sadok, D; Endo, PT","Much work has recently identified the need to combine deep learning with extreme learning in order to strike a performance balance with accuracy, especially in the domain of multimedia applications. When considering this new paradigm-namely, the convolutional extreme learning machine (CELM)-we present a systematic review that investigates alternative deep learning architectures that use the extreme learning machine (ELM) for faster training to solve problems that are based on image analysis. We detail each of the architectures that are found in the literature along with their application scenarios, benchmark datasets, main results, and advantages, and then present the open challenges for CELM. We followed a well-structured methodology and established relevant research questions that guided our findings. Based on 81 primary studies, we found that object recognition is the most common problem that is solved by CELM, and CCN with predefined kernels is the most common CELM architecture proposed in the literature. The results from experiments show that CELM models present good precision, convergence, and computational performance, and they are able to decrease the total processing time that is required by the learning process. The results presented in this systematic review are expected to contribute to the research area of CELM, providing a good starting point for dealing with some of the current problems in the analysis of computer vision based on images.",0

85,2020.0,Status of Groundwater Potential Mapping Research Using GIS and Machine Learning,"Saro, L; Fetemeh, R","Water resources which is formed of surface and groundwater, are considered as one of the pivotal natural resources worldwide. Since last century, the rapid population growth as well as accelerated industrialization and explosive urbanization lead to boost demand for groundwater for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. In fact, better management of groundwater can play crucial role in sustainable development; therefore, determining accurate location of groundwater based groundwater potential mapping is indispensable. In recent years, integration of machine learning techniques, Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) are popular and effective methods employed for groundwater potential mapping. For determining the status of the integrated approach, a systematic review of 94 directly relevant papers were carried out over the six previous years (2015-2020). According to the literature review, the number of studies published annually increased rapidly over time. The total study area spanned 15 countries, and 85.1% of studies focused on Iran, India, China, South Korea, and Iraq. 20 variables were found to be frequently involved in groundwater potential investigations, of which 9 factors are almost always present namely slope, lithology (geology), land use/land cover (LU/LC), drainage/river density, altitude (elevation), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance from river, rainfall, and aspect. The data integration was carried random forest, support vector machine and boost regression tree among the machine learning techniques. Our study shows that for optimal results, groundwater mapping must be used as a tool to complement field work, rather than a low-cost substitute. Consequently, more study should be conducted to enhance the generalization and precision of groundwater potential map.",1
