Different business approaches have emerged with innovative ideas on creating intelligent services and profitable business ecosystems with many actors involved in various value chains. In this transition process, the design of business models plays an essential role to a company's growth and success, and requires a mindset shift in how to create and capture value for companies in the connected world. In order to adapt to the global and collaborative business environment, some of the traditional business models are further developed to adjust to the Internet-of-things context, and some new ones have emerged. The aim of this study is therefore to survey these business modeling and design methods, identify their characteristics, and analyze how they manage the dynamic, global, and collaborative environment in the Internet-of-things business ecosystem. We discuss also the challenges related to the business model transformation process for businesses, including data, services, transition process, and legal and regulation perspectives.","[Breivold, Hongyu Pei; Rizvanovic, Larisa] ABB Corp Res, Ind Internet Of Things, Vasteras, Sweden",,"Breivold, HP (corresponding author), ABB Corp Res, Ind Internet Of Things, Vasteras, Sweden.",hongyu.pei-breivold@se.abb.com; larisa.rizvanovic@se.abb.com,,,Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research through the project Internet-of-things and Cloud for Intelligent Manufacturing [SM16-0025],Special acknowledgement to the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research through the project Internet-of-things and Cloud for Intelligent Manufacturing (SM16-0025).,,37,1,1,24,38,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-7235-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,524,531,,10.1109/CLOUD.2018.00073,,,8,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BL6YD,WOS:000454741700066,,,,,2022-02-22,1

With the introduction of miniaturized sensors and actuators, V-IoT has demonstrated the ability to improve the level of urban transport systems through the development and deployment of low-cost but powerful technologies which seamlessly upgrade the level of smart transportation in urban environments. In this research article, we have presented the features of V-IoT that encompass both the benefits and potential challenges of the technology. Low-cost IoT prototypes have been built and tested for numerous functions in vehicular environments. The monitored parameters include air, road conditions such as traffics flow sizes, air quality, weather parameters, and signal status in terms of Received signal strength indicator, and Signal noise ratio for both road and intra-vehicular environments. Devices are implemented at every IoT architectural layer and tested on a web-based IoT front-end application using different protocols like LoRaWAN. Two LoRa sensors have been deployed in the public bus to monitor some of the mentioned parameters on a real-time basis and historical data could be retrieved through the developed web-based dashboard.

These devices can be useful data sources for Activity Recognition by using Machine Learning. However, as the set of available sensors may vary over time, e.g. due to mobility of the sensors and technical failures, the feature space might also change over time. Moreover, the labelled data necessary for the training is often costly to acquire. Active Learning is a type of Interactive Machine Learning where the model is given a budget for requesting labels from an oracle, and aims to maximize accuracy by careful selection of what data points to label. It is generally assumed that a query always gets a correct response, but in many real-world scenarios this is not a realistic assumption. In this work we investigate different Proactive Learning strategies, which explore the human factors of the oracle and aspects that might influence a user to provide or withhold labels. We implemented four proactive strategies and hybrid versions of them. They were evaluated on two datasets to examine how a more proactive, or reluctant, user affects performance. The results show that a more proactive user can improve the performance, especially when the user is influenced by the accuracy of earlier predictions. The experiments also highlight challenges related to evaluating performance when the set of classes is changing over time.","[Tegen, Agnes; Davidsson, Paul; Persson, Jan A.] Malmo Univ, Internet Things & People Res Ctr, Malmo, Sweden",,"Tegen, A (corresponding author), Malmo Univ, Internet Things & People Res Ctr, Malmo, Sweden.",agnes.tegen@mau.se; paul.davidsson@mau.se; jan.a.persson@mau.se,"Davidsson, Paul/B-2969-2012","Davidsson, Paul/0000-0003-0998-6585",Knowledge Foundation through the Internet of Things and People grant [20140035],This research was partially funded by the Knowledge Foundation through the Internet of Things and People grant number 20140035.,,22,1,1,2,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-7207-7,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,10.1145/3365871.3365881,,,8,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BP3AH,WOS:000545971900010,,,,,2022-02-22,0

We present a review of Internet of Things application platforms with an attempt to identify the common ground for the creation of Internet of Things application marketplaces. Based on the observations from the review we identify the general trends followed by the Internet of Things platforms and propose a general design intended to shape the realization of application marketplaces fostering open innovation for Internet of Things.","[Munjin, Dejan; Morin, Jean-Henry] Univ Geneva, Inst Serv Sci, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Munjin, D (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst Serv Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.",Dejan.Munjin@unige.ch; Jean-Henry.Morin@unige.ch,,,,,,22,7,7,2,11,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-0-7695-4865-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,156,162,,10.1109/GreenCom.2012.33,,,7,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BEJ44,WOS:000316905100021,,,,,2022-02-22,1

Cloud computing solutions are often used to handle these tasks. However, the increasing availability of computational resources close to the edge has prompted the idea of using these for distributed computing and storage. Edge computing may help to improve IoT systems regarding important quality attributes like latency, energy consumption, privacy, and bandwidth utilization. However, deciding where to deploy the various application components is not a straightforward task. This is largely due to the trade-offs between the quality attributes relevant for the application. We have performed a systematic mapping study of 98 articles to investigate which quality attributes have been used in the literature for assessing IoT systems using edge computing. The analysis shows that time behavior and resource utilization are the most frequently used quality attributes; further, response time, turnaround time, and energy consumption are the most used metrics for quantifying these quality attributes. Moreover, simulation is the main tool used for the assessments, and the studied trade-offs are mainly between only two qualities. Finally, we identified a number of research gaps that need further study. (C) 2020 The Authors.

In the SIoT it is very important to set appropriate rules in the objects to select the right friends as these impact the performance of services developed on top of this social network. In this work, we addressed this issue by analyzing possible strategies for the benefit of overall network navigability. We first propose five heuristics, which are based on local network properties and that are expected to have an impact on the overall network structure. We then perform extensive experiments, which are intended to analyze the performance in terms of giant components, average degree of connections, local clustering, and average path length. Unexpectedly, we discovered that minimizing the local clustering in the network allowed for achieving the best results in terms of average path length.

Similarly, users enter and/or leave the IoT environment while being interested in fulfilling their individual needs. These key aspects must be considered while designing and realizing IoT systems. In this paper we propose ECo-IoT, an architectural approach to enable the automated formation and adaptation of Emergent Configurations (ECs) in the IoT. An EC is formed by a set of things, with their services, functionalities, and applications, to realize a user goal. ECs are adapted in response to (un)foreseen context changes e.g., changes in available things or due to changing or evolving user goals.

Although the first studies on IoEHT focused on energy harvesting (EH) as an auxiliary power provisioning method, now completely battery-free and self-sufficient systems are envisioned. Taking advantage of diverse sources that the concept of Smart City offers helps us to fully appreciate the capacity of EH. In this way, we address the primary shortcomings of IoEHT; availability, unreliability, and insufficiency by the Internet of Hybrid EH Things (IoHEHT). In this paper, we survey the various EH opportunities, propose an hybrid EH system, and discuss energy and data management issues for battery-free operation.

Gateway functionality virtualization, on the other hand, makes it easier to make software updates, run and stop functionalities, and add and remove features, such as support for a new protocol, on the fly. The gateway architecture supports edge computing, which aims to process data at the network edge instead of doing everything in the cloud. The paper discusses lightweight virtualization techniques, implementation of gateway architecture and some of the real usage scenarios. Finally, the implemented gateway is evaluated in a real world scenario.","[Karhula, Pekka; Makela, Jukka; Rivas, Helena; Valta, Mikko] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Oulu, Finland",,"Karhula, P (corresponding author), VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Oulu, Finland.",pekka.karhula@vtt.fi; jukka.makela@vtt.fi; helena.rivas@gmail.com; mikko.valta@vtt.fi,,,TekesFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES); VTT,"The research work was done as part of Tekes-funded 5GTN (5G Test Network) and Naked Approach projects, and in VTT-funded Energy Aware Learning in Cognitive Radios and Networks (AWARENESS) project.",,14,2,2,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-5873-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,151,156,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BJ5FR,WOS:000425861800027,,,,,2022-02-22,1

Smart devices will reduce energy use, keep our homes safe, and improve our health. However, as recent attacks have shown, these devices also create tremendous security vulnerabilities in our computing networks. Securing all of these devices is a daunting task. In this paper, we argue that IoT device communications should be default-off and desired network communications must be explicitly enabled. Unlike traditional networked applications or devices like a web browser or PC, IoT applications and devices serve narrowly defined purposes and do not require access to all services in the network. Our proposal, Bark, a policy language and runtime for specifying and enforcing minimal access permissions in IoT networks, exploits this fact. Bark phrases access control policies in terms of natural questions (who, what, where, when, and how) and transforms them into transparently enforceable rules for IoT application protocols. Bark can express detailed rules such as Let the lights see the luminosity of the bedroom sensor at any time and Let a device at my front door, if I approve it, unlock my smart lock for 30 seconds in a way that is presentable and explainable to users. We implement Bark for Wi-Fi/IP and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks and evaluate its efficacy on several example applications and attacks.","[Hong, James; Levy, Amit; Levis, Philip] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Riliskis, Laurynas] Harmonyai, Stanford, CA USA",,"Hong, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hongjn@cs.stanford.edu; levya@cs.stanford.edu; laurynas@harmony.ai; pal@cs.stanford.edu,,"Levy, Amit/0000-0003-1479-8917",Intel/NSF CPS Security grant [1505684]; Stanford Data Science Initiative; Secure Internet of Things Project,"We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and feedback.

Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems aim to connect and scale billions of devices in various domains such as transportation, industry, smart home/city, medical services, and energy systems. Different wireless and wired technologies link sensors and systems together, through wireless access points, gateways, and routers that in turn connect to the web and cloud-based intelligence. IoT architectures make great demands on network control methods for the efficient management of massive amounts of nodes and data. Therefore, some of the cloud's management tasks should be distributed around the edges of networked systems, utilizing fog computing to control and manage, e.g., network resources, quality, traffic prioritizations, and security. In this work, we present adaptive edge computing solutions based on regressive admission control (REAC) and fuzzy weighted queueing (FWQ) that monitor and react to network quality-of-service (QoS) changes within heterogeneous networks, and in a vehicular use case scenario utilizing IEEE 802.11p technology.

The IoT system with billions of devices generates a huge amount of evidence which causes big challenges to digital investigators and practitioners who are required to interact with IoT devices to investigate cybercrimes in a forensically sound and timely fashion. These challenges create more opportunities for cybercrimes to attack various IoT application and services resulting in a direct impact on IoT users. As the IoT has incorporated in most aspects of our life, cybercrimes will literally threaten human life, hence, IoT forensics is required to investigate and mitigate against such attacks. Therefore, this paper provides a detailed review of IoT forensics. It started by providing a comprehensive discussion of IoT security involving the need for security by design and security challenges of the IoT system. Then, a review of IoT forensics is presented by highlighting the need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in IoT forensics, state-of-theart research and recent studies, opportunities and key requirements for a successful IoT forensics.

We strongly believe that the extended conceptual framework and its referential architecture are able to deliver the novel and meaningful insight as a standardized platform for describing and achieving the goals of IoT-communities and societies.","[Kim, Meesun; Ahn, Hyun; Kim, Kwanghoon Pio] Kyonggi Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Collaborat Technol Res Lab, 154-42 Kwangkyosan Ro, Suwon 16227, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",,"Kim, KP (corresponding author), Kyonggi Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Collaborat Technol Res Lab, 154-42 Kwangkyosan Ro, Suwon 16227, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",mskim@kgu.ac.kr; hahn@kgu.ac.kr; kwang@kgu.ac.kr,"Ahn, Hyun/AAG-1599-2019; Kim, Kwanghoon/B-6723-2009","Ahn, Hyun/0000-0003-2326-4853; Kim, Kwanghoon/0000-0001-6320-2556","KGU research grant - Kyonggi University, Republic of Korea [2015-083]","This work was supported by the KGU research grant (Grant No. 2015-083) funded by Kyonggi University, Republic of Korea.

Some of them are open platforms, enabling both the integration of people, systems, and objects from the physical and virtual world, and the visualization of data. For example, there are already some IoT platforms used, like Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, Amazon Web Services IoT Platform, IBM Watson IoT Platform, Nimbits, Open.

We propose a game in which the things connected to IoT can play in real time different sounds, according to the values of some monitored parameters. These things can be grouped in the IoT platform to create a virtual orchestra and make music. Besides this game allowing the creation of great songs, it can be widely used to explain the new ideas behind the fast emerging areas of the Internet of Things.

A useful concept for supporting this effort is Emergent Configurations (ECs). An EC consists of a dynamic set of devices that cooperate temporarily to achieve a user goal.

The multiple aspects of IoT, and the increasingly large number of devices, technologies and platforms in the field, led to the development of IoT technology in many areas. The Internet of Things is a technology that will allow the entry into a new economic era for the entire globe. IoT is a concept that defines a world where all the objects (cars, appliances, lighting systems, mobile devices, portable devices etc.) are connected to each other via the Internet. In this paper, there are presented the most important characteristics and major applications of IoT, and the technological challenges that the Internet of Things is facing. IoT is not the result of a single new technology, several complementary technical advances provide capabilities that, together, help to bridge the gap between the virtual world and the physical one. These capabilities support the IoT and the prospects of its development. In conclusion, businesses will need to begin to implement IoT technology if they want to survive over the long term, but they will also have to implement strategies that account for the many risks associated with the Internet of things.","[Savu, Daniel; Tomescu, Mihaela; Bajenaru, Lidia] ICI Bucuresti, Inst Natl Cercetare Dezvoltare Informat, Bucharest, Romania",,"Savu, D (corresponding author), ICI Bucuresti, Inst Natl Cercetare Dezvoltare Informat, Bucharest, Romania.",dsavu@ici.ro; mtomescu@ici.ro; lidia.bajenaru@ici.ro,,,,,,12,5,5,2,2,INST NATL CERCETARE-DEZVOLTARE INFORMATICA-ICI,BUCHAREST,"8-10 MARESAL A AVERESCU AV, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 011455, ROMANIA",1220-1758,1841-4303,,ROM J INF TECH AUT C,Rom.

Many buzzwords like smart cities, smart homes, and smart wrists exemplify thing democratization. Unfortunately, Internet of Things (IoT) adoption is slowing down due to first, the nature of things being usually passive and second, the multiplicity of things' development tools and communication standards. Both are impacting the quality of IoT applications and undermining the capabilities that these applications could offer to users. In this position paper, we discuss the agentification of things, using norms and commitments, as a means to address their passive nature. At the conceptual level, norms ensure that things operate in accordance to users' best interests. Also, at the operational level, commitments ensure that things will not deviate from the prescribed norms and hence, avoid violations that could lead to penalties. An architecture supporting thing agentification along with some ongoing efforts are discussed in this paper.","[Maamar, Zakaria] Zayed Univ, Coll Technol Innovat, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Faci, Noura] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, LIRIS, Lyon, France; [Kallel, Slim] Univ Sfax, ENIS, ReDCAD, Route Soukra, Sfax 3038, Tunisia; [Sellami, Mohamed] ISEP Paris, LISITE, Paris, France; [Ugljanin, Emir] State Univ Novi Pazar, Dept Tech Sci, Novi Pazar, Serbia; [Kallel, Slim] FSEGS, Comp Sci Dept, BP 1088, Sfax 3028, Tunisia",,"Kallel, S (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, ENIS, ReDCAD, Route Soukra, Sfax 3038, Tunisia.; Kallel, S (corresponding author), FSEGS, Comp Sci Dept, BP 1088, Sfax 3028, Tunisia.",slim.kallel@fsegs.rnu.tn,"Maamar, Zakaria/A-1103-2012","Kallel, Slim/0000-0002-2824-167X; Faci, Noura/0000-0001-7428-6302",,,,14,0,0,1,2,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",2476-1508,,,INTERNET TECHNOL LET,Internet.

Connecting many stand-alone IoT systems through the Internet introduces many challenges, with security being front-and-center since much of the collected information will be exposed to a wide and often unknown audience. Unfortunately, due to the intrinsic capability limits of low-end IoT devices, which account for a majority of the IoT end hosts, many traditional security methods cannot be applied to secure IoT systems, which open a door for attacks and exploits directed both against IoT services and the broader Internet. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a unified IoT framework based on the MobilityFirst future Internet architecture that explicitly focuses on supporting security for the IoT. Our design integrates local IoT systems into the global Internet without losing usability, interoperability and security protection. Specifically, we introduced an IoT middleware layer that connects heterogeneous hardware in local IoT systems to the global MobilityFirst network.

In order to understand further this intelligent infrastructure, our contribution aims to investigate the Internet of Things by a revised conceptualization of the topic. The investigation has been carried out on a scientific contribution produced in the last twenty years for economic and corporate purpose, in order to comprehend and manage the new opportunities offered to economic activity from Internet of Things. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a qualitative approach with the inclusion of a single method approach. In this way, following an analysis of existing literature on the Internet of Things we have applied four keywords (Internet of Thing, Communication Internet, Energy Internet and Logistics Internet) in two databases (Google Scholar and Ebsco) to provide a range of scientific contributions to fill out the literature review. Research is developed according to the study of national and international literature. Originality/value - The Internet of Things will connect everything to everyone in a connected network made up of a Communications Internet, Logistics Internet and Energy Internet in a single integrated system. It has been estimated that in 2020 over 200 billion sensor devices will be connected, creating a market size that in 2025 will be between $2,7 trillion and $3 trillion per year. These devices promise efficiency, social and individual benefits through quantification and monitoring of previously immeasurable qualities. Therefore, the analysis of the literature on Internet of Things, in the time frame between 1995-2015, represents the method to fully appreciate the characteristics, opportunities, possible applications, risks and possible issues linked to the topic.

However, intrinsic features of IoT result in a number of challenges, such as decentralization, poor interoperability, privacy, and security vulnerabilities. Blockchain technology brings the opportunities in addressing the challenges of IoT. In this paper, we investigate the integration of blockchain technology with IoT. We name such synthesis of blockchain and IoT as blockchain of things (BCoT). This paper presents an in-depth survey of BCoT and discusses the insights of this new paradigm. In particular, we first briefly introduce IoT and discuss the challenges of IoT. Then, we give an overview of blockchain technology. We next concentrate on introducing the convergence of blockchain and IoT and presenting the proposal of BCoT architecture. We further discuss the issues about using blockchain for fifth generation beyond in IoT as well as industrial applications of BCoT.

In this paper we focus on the development of IoT-based smart services for solving urban problems that involve IoT-enabled Observation, Orientation, Decision, and Action (OODA) loops. We also focus on how to efficiently support such OODA loops in situations where such loops involve internet-scale data. More specifically, IoT supports Observation via the discovery of sensors and the integration of their data. It supports Orientation via a contextualisation process that refines such data to include only those that are relevant to the situation and/or activities of each specific individual or group. As IoT contextualisation potentially involves internet-scale data, performing this process efficiently allows for fast decision making, and this in turn permits carrying out a timely Action. In this paper we propose an approach and related techniques for performing internet-scale data contextualisation. In particular, we propose IoT-based contextualisation techniques that effectively consider the entire range of data that is being collected in smart cities and use such data to provide hyper-personalised information to each user, i. e., information that best suits the context of each user in the Smart City. We exemplify the proposed contextualisation solution in a smart parking space recommender application/service, and provide an experimental evaluation of this service to illustrate the benefits of our solution.","[Yavari, Ali] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jayaraman, Prem Prakash; Georgakopoulos, Dimitrios] Swinburne Univ Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Yavari, A (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",ali.yavari@rmit.edu.au; pjayaraman@swin.edu.au; dgeorgakopoulos@swin.edu.au,"Yavari, Ali/D-4867-2011","Yavari, Ali/0000-0002-0588-5931; Jayaraman, Prem Prakash/0000-0003-4500-3443; Georgakopoulos, Dimitrios/0000-0001-7880-2140",,,,23,14,14,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-4130-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,454,459,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BH3IX,WOS:000399698600079,,,,,2022-02-22,0

The purpose of this paper was to propose the adaptive IoT and WoT convergence platform that enables things to dynamically implement the smart Web without any controls from users. The adaptive IoT and WoT convergence platform, proposed in this paper, is a new type of platform which provides global inter-compatibility to help users to easily communicate with things by connecting through the webs. Through mashup of the things connected to the Web, coarsely or finely, this proposal can guarantee an efficient IoT or WoT platform management, adaptive synchronization between the things, a stable platform environment, and creating new services. The performance of our proposed platform is tested via experiments which verify that its simulations are satisfactory.","[Yu, Jaehak; Bang, Hyo-Chan; Lee, Hosung] ETRI, IoT Convergence Div, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lee, Yang Sun] Mokwon Univ, Div Convergence Comp & Media, Daejeon, South Korea",,"Lee, YS (corresponding author), Mokwon Univ, Div Convergence Comp & Media, Daejeon, South Korea.",dbzzang@etri.re.kr; bangs@etri.re.kr; hosung.lee@etri.re.kr; yslee48@gmail.com,"Lee, Yangsun/Q-9948-2019","Lee, Yang Sun/0000-0002-1268-2016",Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) Grant - Korea government [15ZC1310],"This work was supported by Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) Grant funded by the Korea government [15ZC1310, Development of USN/WoT Convergence Platform for Internet of Reality Service Provision].",,37,17,17,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-8542,1573-0484,,J SUPERCOMPUT,J.

The trend with this new paradigm where smart embedded devices, people, and systems are connected, is that over the next few years we could see a shift in the notion of what it means to be on the Internet. In this context, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology is an essential component of IoT because it consists of a collection of sensor nodes connected through wireless channels, capable of providing digital interfaces to the real-world things. Moreover, as it occurs in IoT, specific WSN applications can be applied to a wide variety of domains like health, agriculture, logistics, wearable computing and others. However, recent works considered as WSN applications are being called as IoT applications without distinguishing the new features that characterize this denomination. Hence, in this paper we propose to contrast IoT and WSN from a conceptual overview, aiming to find out the relationship between them and to highlight their differences in terms of (i) the thesaurus proposed by IEEE, ACM and UNESCO; (ii) by performing a chronological review of the concepts since these terms appeared; (iii) the definition issued by reference organizations and researchers; and (iv) the main application requirements addressed by reference architectures proposed for both fields of study.","[Manrique, Johana A.; Rueda-Rueda, Johan S.; Portocarrero, Jesus M.

As more devices are added to the Internet each day, controlling their interaction has become very challenging. The goal of this project is to create a software solution that will manage connected devices and allow users to specify the meaning of the device interactions. To achieve this, we are currently creating an Internet of Things platform, Wendo, to handle device connections, and a website to manage these devices. The platform is hardware agnostic allowing users to run the software on their own devices that support the communication standards they need. Additionally, Wendo can be extended easily to support new communication standards as they are released. To allow non-programmers to take advantage of our platform, we created ThingScript, a simple domain-specific language that has an English-like syntax that can be adopted by end-users to defme the relationship between devices.

To address this limitation, this paper proposes mutation as a novel mechanism for making things responsive and hence, capable of either satisfying unseen needs or seizing unexpected opportunities. To approve/deny mutation, a decision-making process is initiated progressing over 4 stopovers (obligation, permission, prohibition, and dispensation) along with 4 stages (awareness, pre-mutation, mutation-itself, and post-mutation) that would allow to answer questions such as why to approve/deny mutation, how to prepare mutation, and how to evaluate mutation.

In many application scenarios, sensors and actuators are distributed over a very wide area; in some cases, they are located in remote areas where they are not served by terrestrial access networks and, as a consequence, the use of satellite communication systems becomes of paramount importance for the Internet of Remote Things (IoRT). The enabling factors of IoRT through satellite are: 1) the interoperability between satellite systems and sensors/actuators and 2) the support of IPv6 over satellite. Furthermore, radio resource management algorithms are required to enhance the efficiency of IoT over satellite. In this work, we provide an integrated view of satellite-based IoT, handling this topic as a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces to be assembled are represented by the following topics: MAC protocols for satellite routed sensor networks, efficient IPv6 support, heterogeneous networks interoperability, quality of service (QoS) management, and group-based communications.","[De Sanctis, Mauro; Cianca, Ernestina] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Elect Engn, I-00175 Rome, Italy; [Araniti, Giuseppe] Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, Dept Informat Engn Infrastruct & Sustainable Ener, I-89124 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Bisio, Igor] Univ Genoa, Dept Telecommun Elect Elect Engn & Naval Architec, I-16146 Genoa, Italy; [Prasad, Ramjee] Aalborg Univ, Ctr TeleInFrastruktur CTIF, DK-9100 Aalborg, Denmark",,"De Sanctis, M; Cianca, E (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Elect Engn, I-00175 Rome, Italy.; Araniti, G (corresponding author), Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, Dept Informat Engn Infrastruct & Sustainable Ener, I-89124 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.; Bisio, I (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Dept Telecommun Elect Elect Engn & Naval Architec, I-16146 Genoa, Italy.; Prasad, R (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Ctr TeleInFrastruktur CTIF, DK-9100 Aalborg, Denmark.",mauro.de.sanctis@uniroma2.it; ernestina.cianca@uniroma2.it; araniti@unirc.it; igor.bisio@unige.it; prasad@es.aau.dk,"Cianca, Ernestina/Q-2721-2015","De Sanctis, Mauro/0000-0002-5712-1204",,,,60,220,223,18,90,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,FEB,2016,3,1,,,SI,,113,123,,10.1109/JIOT.2015.2487046,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,DH9EK,WOS:000373099000010,,Green Published,,,2022-02-22,0

However, the current research and development activities in the field do not mandate the features of multimedia objects, thus leaving a gap to benefit from multimedia content based services and applications. In this paper, we analyze this issue by contemplating the concept of IoT and drawing an inspiration towards the perspective vision of 'Internet of Multimedia Things' (IoMT). Therein, we introduce IoMT as a novel paradigm in which smart heterogeneous multimedia things can interact and cooperate with one another and with other things connected to the Internet to facilitate multimedia based services and applications that are globally available to the users. Some applications and use-cases for IoMT are presented to reflect the possibilities enabled by this new paradigm. An IoMT architecture is then presented which is segregated into four distinct stages; (i) multimedia sensing, (ii) reporting and addressability, (iii) multimedia-aware cloud, and (iv) multi-agent systems. Instead of proposing specific technical solutions for each individual stage of the presented architecture, we survey the already existing technologies, providing a synthesis for the realization of the vision of IoMT. Subsequently, various requirements and challenges as well as the feasibility of existing solutions for each stage of proposed IoMT architecture are comprehensively discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile in the unseen digital domain, where data swirls imperceptible to humans, the atmosphere is thick with the rapidly-moving data packets and content that constitute inter-machine chatter. Contrasting the visible calm in the physical world with obscured bedlam in the digital otherworld sets the scene for the argument we present in this paper.

The demand-side management (DSM) of energy systems has drawn considerable industrial and academic attention in attempts to form new flexibilities to respond to variations in renewable energy inputs to the system. However, many DSM concepts are still in the experimental demonstration phase. One of the obstacles to DSM usage is that the current information infrastructure was mainly designed for centralized systems, and does not meet DSM requirements. To overcome this barrier, this paper proposes a novel information infrastructure named the Internet of Energy Things (IoET) in order to make DSM practicable by basing it on the latest wireless communication technology: the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN). The primary advantage of LPWAN over general packet radio service (GPRS) and area Internet of Things (IoT) is its wide-area coverage, which comes with minimum power consumption and maintenance costs. Against this background, this paper briefly reviews the representative LPWAN technologies of narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Long Range (LoRa) technology, and compares them with GPRS and area IoT technology. Next, a wireless-to-cloud architecture is proposed for the IoET, based on the main technical features of LPWAN. Finally, this paper looks forward to the potential of IoET in various DSM application scenarios. (C) 2017 THE AUTHORS.

Such attention to the things due to several factors, including: the modern understanding of space and time, the expansion of the current real crisis idealistic philosophical ideas, the reorientation of phenomenology. In a situation of rapid development of information technologies there is such a phenomenon as the Internet of things, which captures not only the conjugation of human individuals in the information network, but also systems and hardware devices that can often go without human intervention.

So, the search (discovery) should be one of the keys for Internet of Things. And we can see here the whole analogue with the Internet itself. But for Internet of things, we will face a lot of challenges for search services.

These ever-growing numbers of devices gather a huge quantity of data that contains very useful data. However, the gathered data contains highly redundant data for a variety of reasons. Redundant data is desirable for its positive impact as it is used to improve the accuracy and reliability of sensed data and make the network fault-tolerant. It also leads to different issues in terms of the network's longevity, data processing cost, network bottleneck, delay in data throughput, and network congestion and contention. This paper presents a spatial redundancy reduction approach for IoT data to reduce the issues of redundant data without compromising the accuracy and reliability of data. In the proposed approach, spatial redundancy reduction is performed through two algorithms. The first algorithm is Correlation Tree Construction (CTC), which is constructed based on the spatial correlation of sensor nodes. Based on the correlation tree, the second algorithm is Data Fusion (DF) to carry out data fusion for correlated sensor nodes to maintain the accuracy and reliability of data and reduce redundancy. The simulation of the proposed approach is carried out using the Cooja simulator and Python. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach shows efficiency in terms of spatial redundancy reduction, accuracy, and integrity. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present an energy-efficient IoT architecture for healthcare applications that leverages clinical and home care scenarios, given their typically fixed, stationary nature, as the mobility of patients is in many cases confined to a room or a building. The architecture is based on intelligent, wired gateways that are power-efficient and low-cost. The gateways link wired/wireless medical sensors and hospital appliances to web services, enabling hospital automation and widespread data collection and aggregation of vital signs in a convenient, and cost-effective approach.","[Granados, Jose; Rahmani, Amir-Mohammad; Liljeberg, Pasi; Tenhunen, Hannu] Univ Turku, Dept Informat Technol, Turku, Finland; [Nikander, Pekka] Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Helsinki, Finland",,"Rahmani, AM (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Informat Technol, Turku, Finland.",josgra@utu.fi; amirah@utu.fi; pekka.nikander@aalto.fi; pakrli@utu.fi; hatenhu@utu.fi,"Rahmani, Amir M./AAJ-8426-2020; Rahmani, Amir/AAF-4232-2019; Nikander, Pekka/AAX-2705-2020","Rahmani, Amir M./0000-0003-0725-1155; Tenhunen, Hannu/0000-0003-1959-6513",,,,9,6,6,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1867-8211,,978-3-319-19656-5; 978-3-319-19655-8,L N INST COMP SCI SO,,,2015,150,,,,,,248,254,,10.1007/978-3-319-19656-5_36,,,7,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BD9RY,WOS:000365176500036,,,,,2022-02-22,0

However, like any emerging and disruptive technology, multiple obstacles are slowing down IoT practical adoption including the passive nature and privacy invasion of things. This paper examines how to empower things with necessary capabilities that would make them proactive and responsive. This means things can, for instance reach out to collaborative peers, (un)form dynamic communities when necessary, avoid malicious peers, and be questioned for their actions. To achieve such empowerment, this paper presents an approach for agentifying things using norms along with commitments that operationalize these norms. Both norms and commitments are specialized into social (i.e., application independent) and business (i.e., application dependent), respectively. Being proactive, things could violate commitments at runtime, which needs to be detected through monitoring. In this paper, thing agentification is illustrated with a case study about missing children and demonstrated with a testbed that uses different IoT-related technologies such as Eclipse Mosquitto broker and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol. Some experiments conducted upon this testbed are also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Things now range from simple Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices to smart wireless sensors, intelligent wireless sensors and actuators, robotic things, and autonomous vehicles operating in consumer, business, and industrial environments. The emergence of intelligent things (static or mobile) in collaborative autonomous fleets requires new architectures, connectivity paradigms, trustworthiness frameworks, and platforms for the integration of applications across different business and industrial domains. These new applications accelerate the development of autonomous system design paradigms and the proliferation of the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT). In IoRT, collaborative robotic things can communicate with other things, learn autonomously, interact safely with the environment, humans and other things, and gain qualities like self-maintenance, self-awareness, self-healing, and fail-operational behavior. IoRT applications can make use of the individual, collaborative, and collective intelligence of robotic things, as well as information from the infrastructure and operating context to plan, implement and accomplish tasks under different environmental conditions and uncertainties. The continuous, real-time interaction with the environment makes perception, location, communication, cognition, computation, connectivity, propulsion, and integration of federated IoRT and digital platforms important components of new-generation IoRT applications. This paper reviews the taxonomy of the IoRT, emphasizing the IoRT intelligent connectivity, architectures, interoperability, and trustworthiness framework, and surveys the technologies that enable the application of the IoRT across different domains to perform missions more efficiently, productively, and completely. The aim is to provide a novel perspective on the IoRT that involves communication among robotic things and humans and highlights the convergence of several technologies and interactions between different taxonomies used in the literature.","[Vermesan, Ovidiu; Bahr, Roy] SINTEF Digital AS, Oslo, Norway; [Ottella, Marco] Infineon Technol Austria AG, Villach, Austria; [Serrano, Martin] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Insight Ctr Data Anal, Galway, Ireland; [Karlsen, Tore; Wahlstrom, Terje; Sand, Hans Erik] NxTech AS, Fredrikstad, Norway; [Ashwathnarayan, Meghashyam] Infineon Technol India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Gamba, Micaela Troglia] CISC Semicond GmbH, Klagenfurt Am Woertersee, India",,"Vermesan, O (corresponding author), SINTEF Digital AS, Oslo, Norway.",Ovidiu.Vermesan@sintef.no,,,,,,123,6,6,9,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-9144,,,FRONT ROBOT AI,Front.

The IoAuT refers to the networks of computing devices embedded in physical objects (Audio Things) dedicated to the production, reception, analysis, and understanding of audio in distributed environments. Audio Things, such as nodes of wireless acoustic sensor networks, are connected by an infrastructure that enables multidirectional communication, both locally and remotely. In this article, we first review the state of the art of this field, then we present a vision for the IoAuT and its motivations. In the proposed vision, the IoAuT enables the connection of digital and physical domains by means of appropriate information and communication technologies, fostering novel applications and services based on auditory information. The ecosystems associated with the IoAuT include interoperable devices and services that connect humans and machines to support human-human and human-machines interactions. We discuss the challenges and implications of this field, which lead to future research directions on the topics of privacy, security, design of Audio Things, and methods for the analysis and representation of audio-related information.","[Turchet, Luca] Univ Trento, Dept Informat Engn & Comp Sci, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Fazekas, Gyoergy] Queen Mary Univ London, Ctr Digital Mus, London E1 4NS, England; [Lagrange, Mathieu] Univ Nantes, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, F-44035 Nantes, France; [Ghadikolaei, Hossein S.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Machine Learning & Optimizat Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Fischione, Carlo] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Network & Syst Engn, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Turchet, L (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Informat Engn & Comp Sci, I-38123 Trento, Italy.",luca.turchet@unitn.it,"Turchet, Luca/M-9679-2013; Shokri-Ghadikolaei, Hossein/S-3116-2016","Turchet, Luca/0000-0003-0711-8098; Shokri-Ghadikolaei, Hossein/0000-0001-6737-0266; Fischione, Carlo/0000-0001-9810-3478",Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [ANR-16-CE22-0012]; European UnionEuropean Commission [688382]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/L019981/1]; U.K. Research and Innovation [EP/S022694/1]; EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/L019981/1] Funding Source: UKRI,"The work of Mathieu Lagrange was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche under Project ANR-16-CE22-0012.

With so many objects connected in IoT solutions, the environment in which they are placed becomes smarter. A software, called middleware, plays a key role since it is responsible for most of the intelligence in IoT, integrating data from devices, allowing them to communicate, and make decisions based on collected data. Then, considering requirements of IoT platforms, a reference architecture model for IoT middleware is analyzed, detailing the best operation approaches of each proposed module, as well as proposes basic security features for this type of software. This paper elaborates on a systematic review of the related literature, exploring the differences between the current Internet and IoT-based systems, presenting a deep discussion of the challenges and future perspectives on IoT middleware. Finally, it highlights the difficulties for achieving and enforcing a universal standard. Thus, it is concluded that middleware plays a crucial role in IoT solutions and the proposed architectural approach can be used as a reference model for IoT middleware.","[da Cruz, Mauro A.

While the Internet of Things is still seeking its own shape, its effects have already stared in making incredible strides as a universal solution media for the connected scenario. Architecture specific study does always pave the conformation of related field. The lack of overall architectural knowledge is presently resisting the researchers to get through the scope of Internet of Things centric approaches. This literature surveys Internet of Things oriented architectures that are capable enough to improve the understanding of related tool, technology, and methodology to facilitate developer's requirements. Directly or indirectly, the presented architectures propose to solve real-life problems by building and deployment of powerful Internet of Things notions. Further, research challenges have been investigated to incorporate the lacuna inside the current trends of architectures to motivate the academics and industries get involved into seeking the possible way outs to apt the exact power of Internet of Things. A main contribution of this survey paper is that it summarizes the current state-of-the-art of Internet of Things architectures in various domains systematically. (C) 2016 The Author.

However, user acceptance of such systems is a critical factor that hinders the adoption of this promising approach due to severe privacy concerns. We present UPECSI, an approach for user-driven privacy enforcement for cloud-based services in the Internet of Things to address this critical factor. UPECSI enables enforcement of all privacy requirements of the user once her sensitive data leaves the border of her network, provides a novel approach for the integration of privacy functionality into the development process of cloud-based services, and offers the user an adaptable and transparent configuration of her privacy requirements. Hence, UPECSI demonstrates an approach for realizing user-accepted cloud services in the Internet of Things.","[Henze, Martin; Wehrle, Klaus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Commun & Distributed Syst, Aachen, Germany; [Kerpen, Daniel; Haeussling, Roger] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sociol Technol & Org, Aachen, Germany; [Hermerschmidt, Lars; Rumpe, Bernhard] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Software Engn, Aachen, Germany",,"Henze, M (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Commun & Distributed Syst, Aachen, Germany.",henze@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; hermerschmidt@se.rwth-aachen.de; dkerpen@soziologie.rwth-aachen.de; rhaeussling@soziologie.rwth-aachen.de; rumpe@se.rwth-aachen.de; wehrle@comsys.rwth-aachen.de,"Henze, Martin/I-3623-2014; Rumpe, Bernhard/S-8216-2016","Henze, Martin/0000-0001-8717-2523; Rumpe, Bernhard/0000-0002-2147-1966; Wehrle, Klaus/0000-0001-7252-4186; Kerpen, Daniel/0000-0003-1556-9913",,,,39,19,19,0,1,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-1-4799-4357-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,191,196,,10.1109/FiCloud.2014.38,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BF0FA,WOS:000378641000028,,Green Submitted,,,2022-02-22,0

Existing works on relation discovery mainly focus on centralized processing. It is not suitable for Internet of things due to unavailable of server, one-point failure, computation bottleneck, and security and business concerns. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach to discover the relations among objects in Internet of things. We first build the distritbuted system model which may include multiple relation discovery tasks. Based on that, we design an approach utilizing distributed spanning tree to extract the relations. Rather than sending all the information to the server, the objects only need to send the information to a local leader object in our algorithm. We also discuss more about how to improve the performance of the proposed approach and how to relax the system constraints.

Also, social media analytics deals with development and evaluation of frameworks and informatics tools to process noisy and unstructured social media data. On the other hand, Internet of Things (IoT) enables the utilization of digital artifacts with well-established solutions and allows things to be connected regardless of location and time. However, a literature review about social media analytics and IoT integration is missing. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review of social media analytics and IoT integration.

Data is at the core of such real-world IoT applications. Analysis, modeling, and reasoning of data are necessary to gain valuable insights. Application developers employ context-aware systems to translate the data into contextual information, which then allows the applications to act cognitively. Context sharing platforms offer a solution to distribute context information to those who may be interested in it, thus enabling context interoperability among different entities. This survey first examines the requirements for sharing context information. It then reviews the relevant literature for context sharing and classifies them based on their requirements and characteristics.

Fortunately, the Internet of Agricultural Things may offer a big volume of business data, including product information and delivery information etc., via its pervasive sensing. These data motivate us to design a data driven quantitative model to evaluate the trust of sensed products in supply chains. The proposed trust model leverages a Bayesian network, where almost all parameters are set by the data rather than experts experiences, to evaluate the trust value of a target product. Finally, a case of pork product is used to show the effectiveness of our trust model.

These aspects also constitute the major challenges in the definition of a storage infrastructure suitable for IoT applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel data model and storage infrastructure for the IoT to address these challenges. Different from other works in the literature, we exploit a document-oriented approach and show how it is suitable to support both heterogeneous and multimedia data. Our solution is built on top of the CouchDB database server, offers a RESTful API, and provides a rich set of features targeted to IoT applications. Moreover, we devise optimized schemes for uploading documents which are specifically tailored to resource-constrained IoT devices. We evaluate our proposed schemes both analytically and with experiments in a real system.","[Di Francesco, Mario] Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sch Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Di Francesco, Mario; Li, Na; Raj, Mayank; Das, Sajal K.] Univ Texas Arlington, Ctr Res Wireless Mobil & Networking, Arlington, TX USA",,"Di Francesco, M (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sch Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",mario.di.francesco@aalto.fi; na.li@mavs.uta.edu; mayank.raj@mavs.uta.edu; das@uta.edu,,"Das, Sajal/0000-0002-9471-0868; Raj, Mayank/0000-0002-1714-9077","US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [IIP-1242521]; TEKESFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES); Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and InnovationFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES); Internet of Things program of TIVIT; Finnish Strategic Centre for Science, Technology and Innovation in the field of ICT","This work has been partially supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant IIP-1242521 and by TEKES, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation, as part of the Internet of Things program of TIVIT, the Finnish Strategic Centre for Science, Technology and Innovation in the field of ICT.

This work presents the conception, design, and evaluation of an Interception Proxy for HTTP and CoAP interoperability. The proposed proxy preserves the organic nature of the Swarm, by allowing a transparent discovery and communication among devices. In this proposal, the proxy constitutes an independent entity that intercepts Swarm communications, and performs the mapping between HTTP and CoAP or vice versa, thus, extending the interaction capabilities of the network. The implementation is based on an existing library and the validation results show the correct functionality of the proxy and its ability of operating in Swarm scenarios.","[Esquiagola, J.; Costa, L.; Calcina, P.; Zuffo, M.] Univ Sao Paulo, Swarm Comp Grp, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,"Esquiagola, J (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Swarm Comp Grp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",john@lsi.usp.br; laisa@lsi.usp.br; pablo@lsi.usp.br; mkzuffo@lsi.usp.br,"Zuffo, Marcelo Knorich/T-4771-2019; Aranda, John E Esquiagola/E-9399-2016; De Biase, Laisa C Costa/E-9300-2016; Calcina-Ccori, Pablo/B-4630-2015; Zuffo, Marcelo Knorich/A-7458-2011","Zuffo, Marcelo Knorich/0000-0002-2973-4476; De Biase, Laisa C Costa/0000-0003-0514-7100; Calcina-Ccori, Pablo/0000-0002-6241-3092; Zuffo, Marcelo Knorich/0000-0002-2973-4476",,,,19,6,6,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-5873-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,59,64,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BJ5FR,WOS:000425861800011,,,,,2022-02-22,0

This research on social attributes can also help to improve the serviceability of the IoT. At present, research on social attributes in the IoT has not modeled the relations of things in the IoT. In this paper, we formulate social attributes of thing, analyze the role of relations that is one of important social attributes in the IoT, and use super network architecture to present the complex relations among physical things.

We study how to utilize semantic IoT data for reasoning of actionable knowledge by applying state-of-the-art semantic technologies. For performing these studies, we have developed a semantic reasoning system operating in a realistic IoT environment. We evaluate the scalability of different reasoning approaches, including a single reasoner, distributed reasoners, mobile reasoners, and a hybrid of them. We evaluate latencies of reasoning introduced by different semantic data formats. We verify the capabilities of promising semantic technologies for IoT applications through comparing the scalability and real-time response of different reasoning approaches with various semantic data formats.

A new framework for the Affective IoT has been developed: EMPATI (EMPATI Mimics Personalities on Affective Things on Internet).

In order to define the process-aware service, we especially, use a business process modeling tool, which is supporting the business process modeling notations based upon the standard specification of OMG-BMIDTF. Each of the activities made up of a process-aware service is associated with either a sensor or an actuator of ARDUINO with a control program embodying its related service. As an operational example, we model an imaginary process-aware service fulfilled by two ARDUINO-sensors such as hygrometer and thermometer, and two ARDUINO-actuators such as buzzer and LED-lighter, and implement their control programs.

They offer a REST web service that describes Object capabilities, receives the logic to be executed, and interacts with other stakeholders. Then, the complete application is seen as a choreography dynamically deployed on various objects. But the main issue of choreographies is the loss of coherence. Because of their unreliability, some networks used in IoT may introduce de-synchronization between Objects, leading to errors and failures. In this paper, we propose a solution to re-introduce coherence in the application, in order to keep the advantages of choreography while dealing with this main issue. An overlay of logical check-points at the application layer defines links between the coherent states of a set of objects and triggers re-synchronization messages. Correcting statements are thus spread through the network, which enables fault recovery in Choreographies.

The aim of the study is developing a theoretical approach to the use of field sensors, agro-robots and unmanned aerial vehicles in solving problems of precision agriculture using the paradigm of the Internet of Things. The authors introduced and proved the position that every agricultural thing can be represented as a service. It description contains a standardized description of the functionality and conditions of its use. The article shows, that things can work with a variety of sensors that can communicate with each other. The article proposes to use of service-oriented architectures to build appropriate solutions. It was confirmed that in the process of solving problems, several autonomous and independent services of agricultural things could exchange messages with other things that have different functional and information capabilities. The choreography of services of agricultural things is used to organize the processes of precision agriculture. The orchestration of such services is used to ensure the information needs of individual things. We have developed a general scenario of typical agricultural things operating in the paradigm of the Internet of Agricultural Things (IoAgT) in solving the problem of active field monitoring. The monitoring process is described as sequential movement along the selected routes of ground agrirobots and drones to commit together with the field sensors of the current situation in the field in different periods of agricultural production - from sampling soil to detect critical situations related to plant diseases, the presence of weeds, pests, and eliminate them. The article shows potential applicability of the proposed approach to a concrete example of solving the problems of monitoring a field sown with grain culture. The article recommends using service-oriented architectures in the implementation of precision farming processes, building algorithms for choreography and orchestration of agricultural things services.","[Abrosimov, Vyacheslav K.] Ltd Roboprob, Rozhdestvenskaya Str 7, Mytishchi 141006, Moscow Region, Russia; [Godzhaev, Zakhid A.] Russian Acad Sci, 1st Inst Sky Proezd,5, Moscow 109428, Russia; [Godzhaev, Zakhid A.] Fed Sci Agroengn Ctr VIM, Innovat & Implementat, 1st Inst Sky Proezd,5, Moscow 109428, Russia; [Prilukov, Alexander, V] Fed Sci Agroengn Ctr VIM, 1st Inst Sky Proezd,5, Moscow 109428, Russia",,"Godzhaev, ZA (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, 1st Inst Sky Proezd,5, Moscow 109428, Russia.; Godzhaev, ZA (corresponding author), Fed Sci Agroengn Ctr VIM, Innovat & Implementat, 1st Inst Sky Proezd,5, Moscow 109428, Russia.",fic51@mail.ru,"Godzhaev, Zakhid/AAG-1248-2021","Godzhaev, Zakhid/0000-0002-1665-3730",,,,12,0,0,4,6,FARM MACHINERY INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH CORP,TOKYO,"1-12-3 DAI-ICHI AMAI BUILDING 2F, KANDA NISHIKICHO, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0054, JAPAN",0084-5841,,,AMA-AGR MECH ASIA AF,AMA-Agric.

Consequently, we present in this paper a multi-layer security aware IoT architecture that aims to secure the entire system by providing security at all layers to ensure secure data collection, transfer, analysis, storage and usage. That is necessary because each layer of the IoT has vulnerabilities and a successful attack on any layer can have far-reaching impact on the whole system. We then proposed a novel security algorithm to protect the IoT system against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks at the application layer, the weakest link in IoT. The algorithm logs record of user activities and actions at given times of the day which it employs to regulate access and prevent DoS attacks.

But things are everywhere, have different colours, come in different flavours, so, building reliable applications that depend on such things imposes great challenges and demand for new approaches to integrate heterogeneous devices smoothly. These new methods should use public and resilient networks, like the Internet, to secure and facilitate the access to things. This paper addresses such constraints and proposes a middleware framework to interact with the devices and their data, all this supported by the use of Web services. It is our goal to design and implement a generic framework where services represent functionalities of sensor networks and provide a dynamic way for high-level applications to interact and program such devices with heterogeneous hardware. By using Web services we benefit from the interoperable technology, cross platform, independency of programming languages, and available on the Web. Those attributes are ideal to combine heterogeneous systems like sensor networks. It is also our goal to create an event-driven system, where the user can subscribe the available services and receive notifications as network data is being processed.","[Valente, Bruno; Martins, Francisco] Univ Lisbon, LaSIGE, Dept Informat, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Valente, Bruno; Martins, Francisco] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal",,"Valente, B (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, LaSIGE, Dept Informat, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal.",bvalente@lasige.di.fc.ul.pt; fmartins@di.fc.ul.pt,"Francisco, Martins C/M-1767-2015","Francisco, Martins C/0000-0002-2379-7257","Fundacao para a Ciencia e TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PTDC/EIA-EIA/115730/2009, PTDC/EIA-EIA/103751/2008]",The authors are partially supported by projects MACAW and PATI of the Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (contracts PTDC/EIA-EIA/115730/2009 and PTDC/EIA-EIA/103751/2008).,,23,8,8,0,0,IARIA XPS PRESS,WILMINGTON,"PO BOX 7827, WILMINGTON, DE 19803 USA",,,978-1-61208-148-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,139,144,,,,,6,Telecommunications,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Telecommunications,BH0GE,WOS:000394878000025,,,,,2022-02-22,1

These applications are accomplished by numerous sensors that detect and share information. When people use the detected information in an IoT system to improve the performance of services, also called the intelligence of the system, this type of IoT is named artificial intelligence of things. This paper proposes a model for improving the flexibility of sensors to enhance the intelligence of IoT. The model defines the quality levels of events and monitoring data for all types of monitoring. In the model, the data or events with different levels have different transmission priority. To reduce energy consumption of detection and transmission, the detecting period of sensors can be set to be longer when the monitored status is normal. In the model application, the sensors shorten the event detection and reaction times. Therefore, the efficiency of monitoring is enhanced. The evaluation demonstrates that the event detection and response times of the proposed mechanism are better than those of other mechanisms.","[Hung, Li-Ling] Aletheia Univ, Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan",,"Hung, LL (corresponding author), Aletheia Univ, Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.",llhung@au.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science in Taiwan [MOST 109-2221-E-156-002],This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science in Taiwan under contracts MOST 109-2221-E-156-002.,,19,0,0,0,0,"LIBRARY & INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV",HUALIEN,"LIBRARY & INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV, HUALIEN, 00000, TAIWAN",1607-9264,2079-4029,,J INTERNET TECHNOL,J.

We develop the semantic models for the Social Internet of Things including device types and their capabilities, users and their relationships, and rules leveraging such models.

These devices such as sensors, actuators, RFIDs are becoming part of our fabric. Internet of Things (IoT) and Social networking paradigms are not new. The increased pervasiveness has resulted not only in human to thing communication but also thing to thing communication. A new paradigm integrating IoT and Social Networks has emerged in recent years called the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) where objects are not only smarter but also socially conscious. Social Internet of Things is analogous to social network of intelligent objects. Trust is considered as a crucial factor in SIoT for objects to establish reliable autonomous communication. This paper proposes a Trust Management scheme for Social Internet of Things where trust between objects is computed based on Direct Observations, Indirect Recommendations, Centrality, Energy and Service Score of the object. The proposed trust model outperforms the existing trust models leading to a better application performance. The trust model is also tested in the presence of On Off selective forwarding attacks. Experimental results prove that the proposed model is reliable and defendant against On Off selective forwarding attacks.","[Kowshalya, A.

Previous studies have focused on managing the obtained data. However, managing the heterogeneous resources that get that data is an area that demands more attention. This work addresses the management of resources in the Internet of Things. This is achieved by proposing a virtual-resource edge layer, which enables access and configuration to constrained physical resources. The architecture presented focuses on the use of virtual resources as a management concept and identifies different approaches in the performance evaluation on edge computing devices. Using the IoT protocol CoAP, virtual resources are exposed in the edge network. An evaluation of a Go CoAP virtual resource is presented.

In this paper we provide an overview of the OpenIoT project, which has developed and provided a first-of-kind open source IoT platform enabling the semantic interoperability of IoT services in the cloud. At the heart of OpenIoT lies the W3C Semantic Sensor Networks (SSN) ontology, which provides a common standards-based model for representing physical and virtual sensors. OpenIoT includes also sensor middleware that eases the collection of data from virtually any sensor, while at the same time ensuring their proper semantic annotation. Furthermore, it offers a wide range of visual tools that enable the development and deployment of IoT applications with almost zero programming. Another key feature of OpenIoT is its ability to handle mobile sensors, thereby enabling the emerging wave of mobile crowd sensing applications. OpenIoT is currently supported by an active community of IoT researchers, while being extensively used for the development of IoT applications in areas where semantic interoperability is a major concern.","[Soldatos, John; Kefalakis, Nikos] Athens Informat Technol, Peania 19002, Greece; [Hauswirth, Manfred; Serrano, Martin] INSIGHT Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland; [Calbimonte, Jean-Paul; Riahi, Mehdi; Aberer, Karl] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, IC, LSIR, Stn 14, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Jayaraman, Prem Prakash; Zaslavsky, Arkady] CSIRO Digital Prod Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2617, Australia; [Zarko, Ivana Podnar; Skorin-Kapov, Lea] Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Herzog, Reinhard] Fraunhofer IOSB, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",,"Zarko, IP (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Unska 3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",jsol@ait.gr; nkef@ait.gr; manfred.hauswirth@deri.org; serrano@deri.org; jean-paul.calbimonte@epfl.ch; mehdi.riahi@epfl.ch; karl.aberer@epfl.ch; prem.jayaraman@csiro.au; arkady.zaslavsky@csiro.au; ivana.podnar@fer.hr; lea.skorin-kapov@fer.hr; Reinhard.Herzog@iosb.fraunhofer.de,"Skorin-Kapov, Lea/AAJ-4737-2021; Calbimonte, Jean-Paul/J-8210-2012; Calbimonte, Jean-Paul/AAW-6802-2021; Zarko, Ivana Podnar/E-8711-2015","Calbimonte, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-0364-6945; Calbimonte, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-0364-6945; Jayaraman, Prem Prakash/0000-0003-4500-3443; SOLDATOS, IOANNIS/0000-0002-6668-3911; Herzog, Reinhard/0000-0001-7198-5247",,,,9,138,140,3,6,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-16546-2; 978-3-319-16545-5,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2015,9001,,,,,,13,25,,10.1007/978-3-319-16546-2_3,,,13,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BD6ME,WOS:000362368400003,,,,,2022-02-22,0

In this paper, we study the minimization problem of the total power to satisfy the required rate constraints in IoT, where the users simultaneously communicate through multiple independent channels. This problem is complicated due to the nonlinear data rate function based on the Shannon capacity formula. To this end, we first transfer the initial problem in power domain to an equivalent problem in rate domain instead of direct approximation for the high data rate. Then, we approximate it to a convex problem with the spectral radius constraints by the use of the Neumann expansion and nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theorem. By doing so, we achieve the close upper bound for this total power minimization problem. Moreover, we obtain the lower bound by making use of the convex relaxation technique, and finally get the global optimal solution by leveraging the branch-and-bound method. Simulation results verify that our proposed algorithms have a good approximation to the global optimal value for the power and rate allocations.","[Zhai, Xiangping; Guan, Xiaoxiao; Yuan, Jiabin] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 211106, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhai, Xiangping; Guan, Xiaoxiao; Yuan, Jiabin] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Novel Software Technol & I, Nanjing 210032, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Chunsheng] Univ British Columbia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Shu, Lei] Nanjing Agr Univ, NAU Lincoln Joint Res Ctr Intelligent Engn, Nanjing 210000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shu, Lei] Univ Lincoln, Sch Engn, Coll Sci, Lincoln INB3235, England; [Shu, Lei] Engn Hub, Lincoln LN67TS, England",,"Zhu, CS (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",blueicezhaixp@nuaa.edu.cn; gxiaoxiao@nuaa.edu.cn; cszhu@ece.ubc.ca; lei.shu@ieee.org; ok@nuaa.edu.cn,"Zhu, Chunsheng/P-2182-2019","Zhu, Chunsheng/0000-0001-8041-0197; Shu, Lei/0000-0002-6700-9347","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61701231]; International and Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan Collaborative Innovation Platforms by Major International Cooperation Projects of Colleges in Guangdong Province [2015KGJHZ026]; Maoming Engineering Research Center of Industrial Internet of Things [517018]","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61701231, in part by the International and Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan Collaborative Innovation Platforms by Major International Cooperation Projects of Colleges in Guangdong Province under Grant 2015KGJHZ026, and in part by the Maoming Engineering Research Center of Industrial Internet of Things under Grant 517018.

In this paper, we present formal specification based on ambient calculus that characterizes the salient features of Internet of things environments.","[Karanja, Evanson Mwangi; Gasennelwe-Jeffrey, Mandu] Univ Botswana, Dept Elect Engn, Gaborone, Botswana; [Masupe, Shedden] BITRI, Technol, Gaborone, Botswana",,"Karanja, EM (corresponding author), Univ Botswana, Dept Elect Engn, Gaborone, Botswana.",Sundayfeb29@gmail.com; smasupe@bitri.co.bw; jeffreym@mopipi.ub.bw,"Mwangi, Karanja/AAJ-6826-2020","Mwangi, Karanja/0000-0002-0251-3497",,,,22,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-4904-6,,,,2018,,,,,,,144,149,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BM7AR,WOS:000467634000026,,,,,2022-02-22,1

It is intended that all objects around us are connected to the network, providing worldwide access to information. This concept is gaining space, thanks to the large number of devices connected to the web, ranging from mobile devices to appliances. In the same time, the development of Internet of Things (IoT) give rise to a number of security-related and ethical issues which gain a new dimension in the light of the increased complexity of these technologies. The biggest problem is that IoT does not concern objects only; it is about the relations between the everyday objects surrounding humans and humans themselves. It's important to emphasize that the majority of connected objects are not personal (as smartphones and PCs) and are unattended. Their physical security is not guaranteed (especially for the public networks) and the control of the objects may be lost sometimes. Cascade failures may appear, caused by the interconnectivity of a large number of devices, difficult to be simultaneously protected over the air transmission, with all the related problems. Despite all this problems, in this paper, we focus on the education area, where IoT can be used to create new trends and tools for Long Life Learning process. Following a person- centred design process, the powerful possibilities opened by the Internet of Things are being included to eLearning in order to enhance the learning experience, and will bring more significant learning spaces and tangibility to the learning process.","[Georgescu, Mircea; Popescu, Daniela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",,"Georgescu, M (corresponding author), Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania.",mirceag@uaic.ro; rdaniela@uaic.ro,"Popescu, Daniela-Elena/C-7199-2011; Popescul, Daniela/ABC-5038-2020; Popescul, Daniela/Q-5160-2019","Popescu, Daniela-Elena/0000-0001-7804-5178; Popescul, Daniela/0000-0002-6230-9914; ",,,,14,3,3,0,11,CAROL I NATL DEFENCE UNIV PUBLISHING HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"PANDURI ST, 68-72, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",2066-026X,,,ELEARN SOFTW EDUC,,,2015,,,,,,,68,71,,10.12753/2066-026X-15-009,,,4,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BF7TO,WOS:000384469000009,,,,,2022-02-22,1

In this paper, we propose an efficient image encryption algorithm that can encrypt a large number of images. First, initial conditions of hyperchaotic Chen system are computed by SHA-512 and chaotic sequences. Then, pixel scrambling, image encryption and cyclic shift are employed to permute the plain image. The XOR operation is also constructed to improve correlation between pixels. Due to the sensitivity of SHA algorithm for the original input, each image has its own unique encryption parameter value. Simulation results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that, compared with related schemes, the proposed scheme is efficient and practical, and it can be used in the requirement of sensitive image protections such as internet of vehicles (IoVs) and wireless body area networks (WBAN).","[Zhang, Mingwu; Peng, Bo; Chen, Yu] Hubei Univ Technol, Sch Comp, Wuhan, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, MW (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Technol, Sch Comp, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",csmwzhang@gmail.com,,,,,,32,2,2,1,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-6838-4,,,,2019,,,,,,,38,43,,10.1145/3338507.3358620,,,6,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BO6WY,WOS:000522475400008,,,,,2022-02-22,1

Experts expect more than 50 billion devices connected to the Internet by 2020 (sensors, smartphones, laptops, cars, clothes, wristwatches, etc.). To ensure communication among these smart things, first we need a proper addressing scheme. However, while in the traditional Internet (of People) usually an end-user communicated with another user identified by a specific (IP) address, in the Internet of Things it will be a common scenario to see that the communication targets a specific set of things, identified by the current status or values of their resources, interfaces, or other context parameters. For example, imagine that we want to receive some traffic information from all the sensor nodes embedded in cars or smartphones that are on a certain street, have moved at least once in the last 5 minutes, and have their batteries charged at more than 20 %. Or, we want to send some targeted advertisements to all the devices that are in the close neighborhood of our restaurant, have a video screen to display the ad, and have allowed in their profile the reception of ads. Multicast groups could be used for that, but traditional multicasting is not scalable for such a large number of groups, as multicast addresses cannot be aggregated. In this paper we propose therefore a context-aware addressing and routing solution based on Bloom filters, to supplement the traditional IPv6. This is a proof-of-concept paper that does not address all the fine details of such a solution; it just aims to show that Bloom filters could be very efficiently used to summarize context information, identify groups of things with certain similar characteristics, and make rapid routing decisions to reach these devices.","[Kalmar, Andras] Interuniv Ctr Telecommun & Informat, Kassai Ut 26, H-4028 Debrecen, Hungary; Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Telecommun & Media Informat, High Speed Networks Lab HSNLab, Budapest, Hungary",,"Kalmar, A (corresponding author), Interuniv Ctr Telecommun & Informat, Kassai Ut 26, H-4028 Debrecen, Hungary.",kalmar@tmit.bme.hu; vida@tmit.bme.hu; maliosz@tmit.bme.hu,,,"FIRST - Future Internet Research, Services and Technology [TAMOP-4.2.2.C- 11/l/KONV-2012-000l]; European UnionEuropean Commission; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF)","This work was supported partially by the TAMOP-4.2.2.C- 11/l/KONV-2012-000l (FIRST - Future Internet Research, Services and Technology) project.

Security and privacy are two of the major challenges in IoT. The essential security requirements of IoT cannot be ensured by the existing security frameworks due to the constraints in CPU, memory, and energy resources of the IoT devices. Also, the centralized security architectures are not suitable for IoT because they are subjected to single point of attacks. Defending against targeted attacks on centralized resources is expensive. Therefore, the security architecture for IoT needs to be decentralized and designed to meet the limitations in resources. Blockchain is a decentralized security framework suitable for a variety of applications. However, blockchain in its original form is not suitable for IoT, due to its high-computational complexity and low scalability. In this article, we propose a sliding window blockchain (SWBC) architecture that modifies the traditional blockchain architecture to suit IoT applications. The proposed SWBC uses previous (n-1) blocks to form the next block hash with limited difficulty in proof-of-work (PoW). The performance of SWBC is analyzed on a real-time data stream generated from a smart home testbed. The results show that the proposed blockchain architecture increases security and minimizes memory overhead while consuming fewer resources.","[Koshy, Prescilla; Babu, Sarath; Manoj, B.

There is a need for health care services that link health behavior to risk factors, such as diet and physical activity, and that provide better advice and feedback to users, which Internet of Things-enabled technologies could facilitate. Objective: The objective of the systematic review will be to identify available Internet of Things-enabled technologies for weight management of children and adolescents (users younger than 18 years). It will also aim to understand the use, effectiveness, and feasibility of these technologies. Methods: We will search the Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest Central, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library databases for studies published after 2010, using a combination of keywords and subject headings related to health activity tracking, youth, and Internet of Things. In addition, a Google search to identify grey literature will be conducted. Two authors will independently screen the titles and abstracts identified from the search and accept or reject the studies according to the study inclusion criteria. Any discrepancies will then be discussed and resolved. The quality of the included studies will be assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklists. Data from included studies will be extracted into a predesigned form to identify the types of devices or apps, Internet of Things applications, and health outcomes related to weight management. Results: A preliminary search on Medline returned 484 results. The publication of the final systematic review is expected in mid-2020. Conclusions: The effectiveness and feasibility of physical activity trackers and consumer wearables for different patient groups have been well reviewed, but there are currently no published reviews that look into these technologies in the wider Internet of Things context. This review aims to address this gap by examining Internet of Things-enabled technologies that are designed for youth weight management and thus inform further research and clinical studies to reduce childhood obesity.","[Lam, Ching; Milne-Ives, Madison; Van Velthoven, Michelle Helena; Meinert, Edward] Univ Oxford, Dept Paediat, Digitally Enabled Populat Hlth Res Grp, Oxford, England; [Meinert, Edward] Imperial Coll London, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth, London, England",,"Meinert, E (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Paediat, Digitally Enabled Populat Hlth Res Grp, Oxford, England.",e.meinert14@imperial.ac.uk,,"Meinert, Edward/0000-0003-2484-3347; Lam, Ching/0000-0002-9137-749X; Milne-Ives, Madison/0000-0001-7628-882X; van Velthoven, Michelle Helena/0000-0003-1245-8759",EIT Health [18654]; Promoting the Internet of Things via Collaborations between HEIS and Industry (PITCH-IN) grant,"CL, MM-I, MH, and EM are supported by grants from EIT Health (grant #18654) and a Promoting the Internet of Things via Collaborations between HEIS and Industry (PITCH-IN) grant.",,36,0,0,0,3,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1929-0748,,,JMIR RES PROTOC,JMIR RES.
