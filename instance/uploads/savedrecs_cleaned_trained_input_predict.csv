Healthcare systems are among these applications that have been revolutionized with IoT, introducing an IoT branch known as the Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT) systems. IoMT systems allow remote monitoring of patients with chronic diseases. Thus, it can provide timely patients' diagnostic that can save their life in case of emergencies. However, security in these critical systems is a major challenge facing their wide utilization. In this article, we present state-of-the-art techniques to secure IoMT systems' data during collection, transmission, and storage. We comprehensively overview IoMT systems' potential attacks, including physical and network attacks. Our findings reveal that most security techniques do not consider various types of attacks. Hence, we propose a security framework that combines several security techniques. The framework covers IoMT security requirements and can mitigate most of its known attacks.",0,1

3,3,2017.0,Clustered Data Collection for Internet of Batteryless Things,"Ju, QA; Zhang, Y","Empowered by energy harvesting technology, Internet of Batteryless Things (IoBT) is considered to be a promising solution for the lifetime constraint of Internet of Things. The varying ambient energy source makes it nontrivial for multiple IoBT nodes to work collaboratively and achieve high-throughput data collection. In this paper, we propose a novel clustered data collection framework for IoBT networks, combining cluster head (CH) selection and lexicographic rate assignment. Using the remaining energy level of the energy storage device as the energy budget, the proposed framework assigns a lexicographic optimal rate vector that enables each IoBT node to fully utilize the scavenged energy and at the same time achieve high and fair data collection rate. Two CH selection schemes are developed. One is optimal CH selection by traversing all the possible CH candidates in the cluster. The other is an approximation search based on the inherent energy consumption features of the lexicographic optimal rate assignment. The real world energy harvesting profile is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Compared with the existing strategies, the proposed framework achieves higher throughput over all range of the data aggregation ratio. The simulation results also demonstrate that the approximation-based CH selection scheme has similar data collection rate performance as that of the optimal CH selection scheme at a much lower computational cost.",1,1

In recent years, the Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm, where objects establish social-like relationships, has become popular as it presents several interesting features to improve network navigability and implement efficient discovery methods. This is due to the intrinsic capability of a SIoT network to come to a solution for a query and quickly reach the required object with a small number of hops, using object friendships. In this paper, a SIoT-based object discovery mechanism is proposed. The novelty of this algorithm is that the next hop to query is chosen based on two properties: one that is intrinsic to the network and is based on object friendships, and an external one that takes into account the similarity between the object and the query. Simulation results prove that a correct balance between the two introduced properties is needed and that the proposed algorithm is able to efficiently solve queries, independently of their popularity and complexity.",1,1

However, Internet of Things security is an essential factor. OAuth is one of the most successful authentication and authorization protocols on the Internet. This article proposes push OAuth and personal OAuth authorization server by expanding OAuth for a secure access to the information on Internet of Things devices. In personal OAuth, the smartphones that communicate with remote servers to deliver information on Internet of Things devices can be the OAuth authorization server. Hospitals (OAuth client) that intend to access the information on Internet of Things devices cannot know millions of OAuth authorization server when the smartphone becomes the OAuth authorization server. This article proposes the push OAuth that changes the OAuth protocol and issues the OAuth token when the OAuth authorization server registers to the OAuth client first. Personal OAuth authorization server is far more trustworthy than using a third-party OAuth authorization server to authenticate because users directly control access to the information generated by Internet of Things devices. The personal OAuth authorization server and push OAuth suggested here are expected to create a more secure Internet of Things environment as users can directly authenticate the OAuth client that can access the information on their Internet of Things devices.",0,1

Towards this, we are exploring distributed, decentralised Information Flow Control (IFC) to enable controlled data flows, end-to-end, according to policy. In this paper we make the case for IFC, as a data-centric control mechanism, for securing IoT architectures. Previous research on IFC focuses on a particular system or application, e.g. within an operating system, with little concern for wide-scale, dynamic systems. To render IFC applicable to IoT, we present a certificate-based model for secure, trustworthy policy specification, that also reflects real-world IoT concerns such as 'thing' ownership.

For that reason, energy efficiency has become a primary design consideration in emerging and future IoT solutions. Already, beaconing and discontinuous transmission/reception is included in the upcoming IoT standards to enable devices to duty cycle between the active and sleep states in order to save energy. In many cases however, this periodic mode of operation results in unnecessary wake-ups that greatly reduce energy efficiency. Event-based communication greatly outperforms periodic triggering in efficiency, since wake-ups occur only when particular events take place.

88,88,2018.0,Dynamic Connectivity Game for Adversarial Internet of Battlefield Things Systems,"Abuzainab, N; Saad, W","In this paper, the problem of network connectivity is studied for an adversarial Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system in which an attacker aims at disrupting the connectivity of the network by choosing to compromise one of the IoBT nodes at each time epoch. To counter such attacks, an IoBT defender attempts to reestablish the IoBT connectivity by either deploying new IoBT nodes or by changing the roles of existing nodes. This problem is formulated as a dynamic multistage Stackelberg connectivity game that extends classical connectivity games and that explicitly takes into account the characteristics and requirements of the IoBT network. In particular, the defender's payoff captures the IoBT latency as well as the sum of weights of disconnected nodes at each stage of the game. Due to the dependence of the attacker's and defender's actions at each stage of the game on the network state, the feedback Stackelberg solution [feedback Stackelberg equilibrium (FSE)] is used to solve the IoBT connectivity game. Then, sufficient conditions under which the IoBT system will remain connected, when the FSE solution is used, are determined analytically. Numerical results show that the expected number of disconnected sensors, when the FSE solution is used, decreases up to 46% compared to a baseline scenario in which a Stackelberg game with no feedback is used, and up to 43% compared to a baseline equal probability policy.",1,1

IoT promises a wide variety of applications to make the human's life more comfortable, safe and improve quality of life. It's also considered as big business opportunity for enterprises based on huge quantity of data gathered by connected Things. In the IoT applications such as smart home, smart city, heath and so on, Things cohabit with humans and deal with their personal data even the most private ones. When this data is collected massively and exposed to Internet without an explicit person's agreement, Things constitute by this way a threat for privacy, which is a universal human right. Thus privacy preservation is one of the most prominent issues in IoT. This paper analyzes the privacy in the context of IoT based on case study, and proposes mechanisms to improve security and preserve privacy.

96,96,2016.0,Building Internet of Things software with ELIoT,"Sivieri, A; Mottola, L; Cugola, G","We present ELIoT, a development platform for Internet-connected smart devices. Unlike most solutions for the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), ELIoT allows programmers to implement functionality running within the networks of smart devices without necessarily leveraging the external Internet, and yet enables the integration of such functionality with Internet-wide services. ELIoT thus reconciles the demand for efficient localized performance, e.g., reduced latency for implementing control loops, with the need to integrate with the larger Internet. To this end, ELloT's programming model provides IoT-specific inter-process communication facilities, while its virtual machine-based execution caters for the need of software reconfiguration and the devices' heterogeneity. Moreover, ELIoT addresses network-wide integration concerns by enabling standard-compliant interactions through REST and CoAP interfaces, with the added ability to dynamically reconfigure REST interfaces as application requirements evolve. We demonstrate the features and effectiveness of ELIoT based on a smart-home application, and quantitatively derive performance figures atop two hardware platforms compared to implementations using plain C or Java using the AllJoin framework. Compared to the C implementation, our results indicate that the performance cost for the increased programming productivity brought by ELIoT is still viable; for example, memory consumption in ELIoT is comparable, whereas the processing overhead remains within practical limits. Compared to the Java implementation using AllJoin, ELIoT provides a similar level of abstraction in programming, with much better performance both in memory consumption and processing overhead.

In order to maintain desirable service quality of the sensed data from the environment, data aggregation-based schemes are highly used. Such schemes gather and aggregate data packets in an efficient manner so as to reduce power consumption, network overhead, and traffic congestion, and to increase network lifetime, data accuracy, etc. In this paper, a hybrid Quality of service-Aware Data Aggregation (QADA) scheme is proposed.

103,103,2019.0,TinyIKE: Lightweight IKEv2 for Internet of Things,"Raza, S; Magnusson, RM","There is unanimous consensus that cyber security in the Internet of Things (IoT) is necessary. In cyber security, key establishment is one of the toughest problems. It is even more challenging in resource-constrained but Internet-connected IoT devices that use low-power wireless communication. A number of IoT communication protocols define cryptographic mechanisms for confidentiality and integrity services but do not specify key management. For example, IEEE 802.15.4, RPL, and object security all rely on external key management protocols. Due to the lack of automatic key management support, IoT devices either end up using preshared keys or no security at all. In this paper, we overcome these challenges and present TinyIKE, a lightweight adaptation of Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) for the IoT. Using TinyIKE, we solve the key establishment problem for multiple IoT protocols using a single IKEv2-based solution. We implement TinyIKE for resource-constrained IoT devices that run the Contiki OS. The TinyIKE implementation supports full certificate-based IKEv2 that uses elliptic curve cryptography.

Typical DoS attacks overload servers with bogus requests, induce them to worthlessly commit resources, and even make them unable to serve legitimate clients. This is especially relevant in Internet of Things scenarios, where servers are particularly exposed and often equipped with limited resources. Although most countermeasures focus on detection and mitigation, they do not react to dynamically adapt victims' behavior, while at the same time preserving service availability. This paper presents SARDOS, a reactive security service that leverages detection mechanisms from different communication layers, and adaptively changes the operative behavior of victim servers while preserving service availability. We experimentally evaluated SARDOS with a prototype implementation running on an underclocked Raspberry Pi server. Our results show that, when running SARDOS, a server under attack displays considerably lower memory and CPU usage, while still ensuring (best-effort) fulfillment of legitimate requests.",0,1

When databased, analyzed, and compared against information from other individuals using data analytics, Healthcare Internet of Things data enables the personalization and modernization of care with radical improvements in outcomes and reductions in cost. In this article, we survey the existing and emerging technologies that can enable this vision for the future of healthcare, particularly, in the clinical practice of healthcare. Three main technology areas underlie the development of this field: 1) sensing, where there is an increased drive for miniaturization and power efficiency; 2) communications, where the enabling factors are ubiquitous connectivity, standardized protocols, and the wide availability of cloud infrastructure; and 3) data analytics and inference, where the availability of large amounts of data and computational resources is revolutionizing algorithms for individualizing inference and actions in health management.

The interaction and communication among these things generate an enormous amount of context-aware data that is semantically diverse. Traditional data representation approaches, such as semantic annotation, ontology, and semantic Web technology are rule based, which lack flexibility and adaptability when applied to IoT. To address the challenge, this article mainly focuses on the problem of semantic representation, which is essential for processing and fusion of IoT data. To serve as a bridge, we propose a high-level framework, namely, Things2Vec, which aims to produce the latent semantic representations from the interaction of things through the graph embedding technique. These semantic representations benefit various IoT semantic analysis tasks, such as the IoT service recommendation and automation of things. In Things2Vec, we utilize the graph to model the function sequence relationships that are generated by the interaction of things, which is called the IoT context graph. Since these function sequence relationships are heterogeneous in terms of semantics, it causes general graph embeddings to fail to learn complete information. Thus, we propose a biased random walk procedure, which is tailored to capture the neighborhoods of nodes with different types of semantic relationships. Extensive experiments are carried out, and our results show that the proposed method can effectively capture the semantic relationships among context-aware data in IoT.",3,1

This paper considers the design and implementation of a practical privacy-preserving collaborative learning scheme, inwhich a curious learning coordinator trains a better machine learning model based on the data samples contributed by a number of IoT objects, while the confidentiality of the raw forms of the training data is protected against the coordinator. Existing distributed machine learning and data encryption approaches incur significant computation and communication overhead, rendering themill-suited for resource-constrained IoT objects. We study an approach that applies independent Gaussian random projection at each IoT object to obfuscate data and trains a deep neural network at the coordinator based on the projected data from the IoT objects. This approach introduces light computation overhead to the IoT objects and moves most workload to the coordinator that can have suficient computing resources. Although the independent projections performed by the IoT objects address the potential collusion between the curious coordinator and some compromised IoT objects, they significantly increase the complexity of the projected data. In this paper, we leverage the superior learning capability of deep learning in capturing sophisticated patterns to maintain good learning performance. Extensive comparative evaluation shows that this approach outperforms other lightweight approaches that apply additive noisification for difierential privacy and/or support vector machines for learning in the applications with light data pattern complexities.",4,1

179,179,2020.0,PP-SPEC: Securing Spectrum Allocation for Internet of Things,"Ding, XY; Tian, X; Liu, XH; Chen, YJ","The explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) is posing a high pressure on the spectrum resources. Dynamic spectrum allocation is an effective solution for supporting massive IoT devices with limited spectrum resources, often implemented in the form of spectrum auction. Among diverse auction formats, double auctions feature multiple buyers and multiple sellers, which is applicable to a wide range of IoT scenarios. Nevertheless, the existing double auction mechanisms mostly focus on the design of truthfulness and ignore the importance of privacy preservation. Hence, in this article, we propose PP-SPEC, a truthful and privacy-preserving double auction mechanism that takes spatial reuse, spectrum heterogeneity, and multiminded bidders into account, and provides full privacy in terms of asking prices, bidding values, and locations. To tackle the challenge of privacy-preserving comparison over ciphertext field, we carefully designed a set of generic privacy-preserving ciphertext comparison protocols (PIC), including basic PIC (B-PIC) and extended PIC (E-PIC), by integrating additive homomorphic encryption and garbled circuits. Furthermore, we have theoretically proved the truthfulness and security of PP-SPEC. We have implemented and evaluated PP-SPEC, whose experimental results show high performance and practicability of PP-SPEC for real-life applications.",0,1

190,190,2015.0,Caching in Named Data Networking for the Wireless Internet of Things,"Hail, MA; Amadeo, M; Molinaro, A; Fischer, S","Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising Information-Centric future Internet architecture. Besides its recognized potentialities as a content retrieval solution in wired domains, NDN has been also recently considered as an enabling technology for the Internet of Things (IoT), thanks to its innovative features like named-based routing and in-network caching. In particular, the possibility of caching at intermediate nodes can be especially useful to reduce the retrieval delay, and limit the network traffic and the load on data producer. However, unlike traditional Internet contents, IoT data are typically transient and periodically refreshed by the producer. At the same time, unlike Internet routers, IoT devices can be resource-constrained, with limitations in terms of energy, storage and processing capabilities. Therefore, caching algorithms designed for (intransient) Internet traffic and Internet routers do not well suit IoT domains. In this paper, we consider a wireless NDN-IoT network and propose a novel distributed probabilistic caching strategy that relies on the freshness of data and on potentially constrained capabilities of devices (energy level and storage capacity). The proposed solution has been evaluated through simulations with ndnSIM and results show that it outperforms traditional NDN caching mechanisms in terms of data retrieval and network energy efficiency.",0,1
