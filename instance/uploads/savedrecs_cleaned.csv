Different business approaches have emerged with innovative ideas on creating intelligent services and profitable business ecosystems with many actors involved in various value chains. In this transition process, the design of business models plays an essential role to a company's growth and success, and requires a mindset shift in how to create and capture value for companies in the connected world. In order to adapt to the global and collaborative business environment, some of the traditional business models are further developed to adjust to the Internet-of-things context, and some new ones have emerged. The aim of this study is therefore to survey these business modeling and design methods, identify their characteristics, and analyze how they manage the dynamic, global, and collaborative environment in the Internet-of-things business ecosystem. We discuss also the challenges related to the business model transformation process for businesses, including data, services, transition process, and legal and regulation perspectives.","[Breivold, Hongyu Pei; Rizvanovic, Larisa] ABB Corp Res, Ind Internet Of Things, Vasteras, Sweden",,"Breivold, HP (corresponding author), ABB Corp Res, Ind Internet Of Things, Vasteras, Sweden.",hongyu.pei-breivold@se.abb.com; larisa.rizvanovic@se.abb.com,,,Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research through the project Internet-of-things and Cloud for Intelligent Manufacturing [SM16-0025],Special acknowledgement to the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research through the project Internet-of-things and Cloud for Intelligent Manufacturing (SM16-0025).,,37,1,1,24,38,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-7235-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,524.0,531,,10.1109/CLOUD.2018.00073,,,8,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BL6YD,WOS:000454741700066,,,,,2022-02-22,

With the introduction of miniaturized sensors and actuators, V-IoT has demonstrated the ability to improve the level of urban transport systems through the development and deployment of low-cost but powerful technologies which seamlessly upgrade the level of smart transportation in urban environments. In this research article, we have presented the features of V-IoT that encompass both the benefits and potential challenges of the technology. Low-cost IoT prototypes have been built and tested for numerous functions in vehicular environments. The monitored parameters include air, road conditions such as traffics flow sizes, air quality, weather parameters, and signal status in terms of Received signal strength indicator, and Signal noise ratio for both road and intra-vehicular environments. Devices are implemented at every IoT architectural layer and tested on a web-based IoT front-end application using different protocols like LoRaWAN. Two LoRa sensors have been deployed in the public bus to monitor some of the mentioned parameters on a real-time basis and historical data could be retrieved through the developed web-based dashboard.

These devices can be useful data sources for Activity Recognition by using Machine Learning. However, as the set of available sensors may vary over time, e.g. due to mobility of the sensors and technical failures, the feature space might also change over time. Moreover, the labelled data necessary for the training is often costly to acquire. Active Learning is a type of Interactive Machine Learning where the model is given a budget for requesting labels from an oracle, and aims to maximize accuracy by careful selection of what data points to label. It is generally assumed that a query always gets a correct response, but in many real-world scenarios this is not a realistic assumption. In this work we investigate different Proactive Learning strategies, which explore the human factors of the oracle and aspects that might influence a user to provide or withhold labels. We implemented four proactive strategies and hybrid versions of them. They were evaluated on two datasets to examine how a more proactive, or reluctant, user affects performance. The results show that a more proactive user can improve the performance, especially when the user is influenced by the accuracy of earlier predictions. The experiments also highlight challenges related to evaluating performance when the set of classes is changing over time.","[Tegen, Agnes; Davidsson, Paul; Persson, Jan A.] Malmo Univ, Internet Things & People Res Ctr, Malmo, Sweden",,"Tegen, A (corresponding author), Malmo Univ, Internet Things & People Res Ctr, Malmo, Sweden.",agnes.tegen@mau.se; paul.davidsson@mau.se; jan.a.persson@mau.se,"Davidsson, Paul/B-2969-2012","Davidsson, Paul/0000-0003-0998-6585",Knowledge Foundation through the Internet of Things and People grant [20140035],This research was partially funded by the Knowledge Foundation through the Internet of Things and People grant number 20140035.,,22,1,1,2,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-7207-7,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,10.1145/3365871.3365881,,,8,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BP3AH,WOS:000545971900010,,,,,2022-02-22,

We present a review of Internet of Things application platforms with an attempt to identify the common ground for the creation of Internet of Things application marketplaces. Based on the observations from the review we identify the general trends followed by the Internet of Things platforms and propose a general design intended to shape the realization of application marketplaces fostering open innovation for Internet of Things.","[Munjin, Dejan; Morin, Jean-Henry] Univ Geneva, Inst Serv Sci, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Munjin, D (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst Serv Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.",Dejan.Munjin@unige.ch; Jean-Henry.Morin@unige.ch,,,,,,22,7,7,2,11,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-0-7695-4865-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,156.0,162,,10.1109/GreenCom.2012.33,,,7,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BEJ44,WOS:000316905100021,,,,,2022-02-22,

Cloud computing solutions are often used to handle these tasks. However, the increasing availability of computational resources close to the edge has prompted the idea of using these for distributed computing and storage. Edge computing may help to improve IoT systems regarding important quality attributes like latency, energy consumption, privacy, and bandwidth utilization. However, deciding where to deploy the various application components is not a straightforward task. This is largely due to the trade-offs between the quality attributes relevant for the application. We have performed a systematic mapping study of 98 articles to investigate which quality attributes have been used in the literature for assessing IoT systems using edge computing. The analysis shows that time behavior and resource utilization are the most frequently used quality attributes; further, response time, turnaround time, and energy consumption are the most used metrics for quantifying these quality attributes. Moreover, simulation is the main tool used for the assessments, and the studied trade-offs are mainly between only two qualities. Finally, we identified a number of research gaps that need further study. (C) 2020 The Authors.

In the SIoT it is very important to set appropriate rules in the objects to select the right friends as these impact the performance of services developed on top of this social network. In this work, we addressed this issue by analyzing possible strategies for the benefit of overall network navigability. We first propose five heuristics, which are based on local network properties and that are expected to have an impact on the overall network structure. We then perform extensive experiments, which are intended to analyze the performance in terms of giant components, average degree of connections, local clustering, and average path length. Unexpectedly, we discovered that minimizing the local clustering in the network allowed for achieving the best results in terms of average path length.

Similarly, users enter and/or leave the IoT environment while being interested in fulfilling their individual needs. These key aspects must be considered while designing and realizing IoT systems. In this paper we propose ECo-IoT, an architectural approach to enable the automated formation and adaptation of Emergent Configurations (ECs) in the IoT. An EC is formed by a set of things, with their services, functionalities, and applications, to realize a user goal. ECs are adapted in response to (un)foreseen context changes e.g., changes in available things or due to changing or evolving user goals.

Although the first studies on IoEHT focused on energy harvesting (EH) as an auxiliary power provisioning method, now completely battery-free and self-sufficient systems are envisioned. Taking advantage of diverse sources that the concept of Smart City offers helps us to fully appreciate the capacity of EH. In this way, we address the primary shortcomings of IoEHT; availability, unreliability, and insufficiency by the Internet of Hybrid EH Things (IoHEHT). In this paper, we survey the various EH opportunities, propose an hybrid EH system, and discuss energy and data management issues for battery-free operation.

The role of the gateway is to allow Internet access for end devices that are not able to implement the full Internet protocol stack. Gateway functionality virtualization, on the other hand, makes it easier to make software updates, run and stop functionalities, and add and remove features, such as support for a new protocol, on the fly. The gateway architecture supports edge computing, which aims to process data at the network edge instead of doing everything in the cloud. The paper discusses lightweight virtualization techniques, implementation of gateway architecture and some of the real usage scenarios. Finally, the implemented gateway is evaluated in a real world scenario.","[Karhula, Pekka; Makela, Jukka; Rivas, Helena; Valta, Mikko] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Oulu, Finland",,"Karhula, P (corresponding author), VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Oulu, Finland.",pekka.karhula@vtt.fi; jukka.makela@vtt.fi; helena.rivas@gmail.com; mikko.valta@vtt.fi,,,TekesFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES); VTT,"The research work was done as part of Tekes-funded 5GTN (5G Test Network) and Naked Approach projects, and in VTT-funded Energy Aware Learning in Cognitive Radios and Networks (AWARENESS) project.",,14,2,2,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-5873-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,151.0,156,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BJ5FR,WOS:000425861800027,,,,,2022-02-22,

However, as recent attacks have shown, these devices also create tremendous security vulnerabilities in our computing networks. Securing all of these devices is a daunting task. In this paper, we argue that IoT device communications should be default-off and desired network communications must be explicitly enabled. Unlike traditional networked applications or devices like a web browser or PC, IoT applications and devices serve narrowly defined purposes and do not require access to all services in the network. Our proposal, Bark, a policy language and runtime for specifying and enforcing minimal access permissions in IoT networks, exploits this fact. Bark phrases access control policies in terms of natural questions (who, what, where, when, and how) and transforms them into transparently enforceable rules for IoT application protocols. Bark can express detailed rules such as Let the lights see the luminosity of the bedroom sensor at any time and Let a device at my front door, if I approve it, unlock my smart lock for 30 seconds in a way that is presentable and explainable to users. We implement Bark for Wi-Fi/IP and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks and evaluate its efficacy on several example applications and attacks.","[Hong, James; Levy, Amit; Levis, Philip] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Riliskis, Laurynas] Harmonyai, Stanford, CA USA",,"Hong, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hongjn@cs.stanford.edu; levya@cs.stanford.edu; laurynas@harmony.ai; pal@cs.stanford.edu,,"Levy, Amit/0000-0003-1479-8917",Intel/NSF CPS Security grant [1505684]; Stanford Data Science Initiative; Secure Internet of Things Project,"We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and feedback.

This article focuses on one of the most important topic for future life and economy - Internet of Things. Research aims. Indicate business models that apply to the Internet Things. Method. Theoretical analysis of the phenomenon of Internet of Things. Analysis of fifty-five business models. Indication of thirty-three models of the Internet of Things. Key findings. Analyzing a broad variety of companies (up to 400 cases) Gass-mann, Frankenberger and Csik identify fifty-five business model patterns that either individually or together build the fundament of the majority of currently existing business models. These models can be the basis of creating business models Internet of Things. The author of this article from fifty-five models selected thirty-three models and pointed their application in the field of Internet of Things. These thirty-three models can be successfully used in the Internet of Things on four specified layers and in eleven areas. These models may also be the starting point for creating new business models or inspiration for the creation of a completely new, innovative models. Specification of these new models will be the target for further studies.","[Kralewski, Dariusz] Univ Gdansk, Fac Management, Dept Business Informat, Gdansk, Poland",,"Kralewski, D (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Fac Management, Dept Business Informat, Gdansk, Poland.",dariusz.kralewski@ug.edu.pl,,"Kralewski, Dariusz/0000-0003-0189-0781",,,,18,3,3,1,10,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-1348,,978-3-319-46642-2; 978-3-319-46641-5,LECT NOTES BUS INF P,,,2016,264.0,,,,,,85.0,103,,10.1007/978-3-319-46642-2_6,,,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Education & Educational Research; Information Science & Library Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Information Science & Library Science,BG8KY,WOS:000392398800006,,,,,2022-02-22,

Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems aim to connect and scale billions of devices in various domains such as transportation, industry, smart home/city, medical services, and energy systems. Different wireless and wired technologies link sensors and systems together, through wireless access points, gateways, and routers that in turn connect to the web and cloud-based intelligence. IoT architectures make great demands on network control methods for the efficient management of massive amounts of nodes and data. Therefore, some of the cloud's management tasks should be distributed around the edges of networked systems, utilizing fog computing to control and manage, e.g., network resources, quality, traffic prioritizations, and security. In this work, we present adaptive edge computing solutions based on regressive admission control (REAC) and fuzzy weighted queueing (FWQ) that monitor and react to network quality-of-service (QoS) changes within heterogeneous networks, and in a vehicular use case scenario utilizing IEEE 802.11p technology. These adaptive solutions are providing more stable network performance and optimizing the network path and resources.","[Jutila, Mirjami] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Oulu 90571, Finland",,"Jutila, M (corresponding author), VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Oulu 90571, Finland.",mirjami.jutila@vtt.fi,,,"TEKES as part of the Internet of Things program of DIGILE (Finnish Strategic Centre for Science, Technology, and Innovation in the field of ICT and Digital Business); VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland; TekesFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)","This work was supported in part by TEKES as part of the Internet of Things program of DIGILE (Finnish Strategic Centre for Science, Technology, and Innovation in the field of ICT and Digital Business) and in part by the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and Tekes.",,23,36,38,1,49,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,DEC,2016,3.0,6.0,,,,,1061.0,1069,,10.1109/JIOT.2016.2550561,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,EJ2OA,WOS:000393048500018,,,,,2022-02-22,
