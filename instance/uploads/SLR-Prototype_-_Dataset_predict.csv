0,A Conceptual Model of ICT-Supported Unified Process of International Outsourcing of Software Production,"This is an ongoing research in international outsourcing software production. This research examines how Software production through the ICTsupported unified process of international outsourcing could be executed and managed effectively. To address this research question, the results of an in-depth literature review in the areas of outsourcing, international outsourcing, information technology, and international software production is presented. This study proposes the information communication technologies' (ICT) - supported unified process model of international outsourcing of software production (SUPMIOSP). ICT-SUPMIOSP provides a detailed guideline on how to manage the entire process of international outsourcing by integrating a number of key issues such as relationship and risks management. Both theoretical and practical aspects of ICTSUPMIOSP are presented. At the theoretical level, the model can be used as a basis for further research, while at the practical level, it helps managers and other stakeholders to understand the multiple activities involved in offshore outsourcing, improve, systematize, and execute the ICT-SUPIOSP more effectively and efficiently.",2006,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4031306,Anicet Yalaho,"EDOCW '06: Proceedings of the 10th IEEE on International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops , October 2006, Publisher: IEEE Computer Society",1
1,A Quantitative Assessment of Requirements Engineering Publications ? 1963?2006,"<p>Requirements engineering research has been conducted for over 40 years. It is important to recognize the plethora of results accumulated to date to: (a) improve researchers' understanding of the historical roots of our field in the real-world and the problems that they are trying to solve, (b) expose researchers to the breadth and depth of solutions that have been proposed, (c) provide a synergistic basis for improving those solutions or building new ones to solve real-world problems facing the industry today, and d) increase practitioner awareness of available solutions. A detailed meta-analysis of the requirements engineering literature will provide an objective overview of the advances and current state of the discipline. This paper represents the first step in a planned multi-year analysis. It presents the results of a demographic analysis by date, type, outlet, author, and author affiliation for an existing database of over 4,000 requirements engineering publications.</p>",2007,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1768914&CFID=932216837&CFTOKEN=18963453,"Alan Davis  , Ann Hickey  , Oscar Dieste  , Natalia Juristo   and Ana Moreno","Book Series Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 4542/2007, Book Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality, Pages 129-143, SpringerLink Date Thursday, June 28, 2007",1
2,A survey and taxonomy of approaches for mining software repositories in the context of software evolution,"<p>A comprehensive literature survey on approaches for mining software repositories (MSR) in the context of software evolution is presented. In particular, this survey deals with those investigations that examine multiple versions of software artifacts or other temporal information. A taxonomy is derived from the analysis of this literature and presents the work via four dimensions: the type of software repositories mined (what), the purpose (why), the adopted/invented methodology used (how), and the evaluation method (quality). The taxonomy is demonstrated to be expressive (i.e., capable of representing a wide spectrum of MSR investigations) and effective (i.e., facilitates similarities and comparisons of MSR investigations). Lastly, a number of open research issues in MSR that require further investigation are identified.</p>",2007,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1345057&CFID=932209910&CFTOKEN=86972045,"Huzefa Kagdi, Michael L.

3,An analysis of data sets used to train and validate cost prediction systems,"OBJECTIVE - to build up a picture of the nature and type of data sets being used to develop and evaluate different software project effort prediction systems. We believe this to be important since there is a growing body of published work that seeks to assess different prediction approaches.METHOD - we performed an exhaustive search from 1980 onwards from three software engineering journals for research papers that used project data sets to compare cost prediction systems.RESULTS - this identified a total of 50 papers that used, one or more times, a total of 71 unique project data sets. We observed that some of the better known and easily accessible data sets were used repeatedly making them potentially disproportionately influential. Such data sets also tend to be amongst the oldest with potential problems of obsolescence. We also note that only about 60% of all data sets are in the public domain. Finally, extracting relevant information from research papers has been time consuming due to different styles of presentation and levels of contextural information.CONCLUSIONS - first, the community needs to consider the quality and appropriateness of the data set being utilised; not all data sets are equal. Second, we need to assess the way results are presented in order to facilitate meta-analysis and whether a standard protocol would be appropriate.",2005,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1083166&CFID=932222344&CFTOKEN=20329875,"Carolyn Mair, Martin Shepperd, Magne J?rgensen","PROMISE '05: Proceedings of the 2005 workshop on Predictor models in software engineering, May 2005",1
4,Challenges in Collaborative Modeling: A Literature Review,"Modeling is a key activity in conceptual design and system design. Users as well as stakeholders, experts and entrepreneurs need to be able to create shared understanding about a system representation. In this paper we conducted a literature review to provide an overview of studies in which collaborative modeling efforts have been conducted to give first insights in the challenges of collaborative modeling, specifically with respect to group composition, collaboration & participation methods, modeling methods and quality in collaborative modeling. We found a critical challenge in dealing with the lack of modeling skills, such as having a modeler to support the group, or create the model for the group versus training to empower participants to actively participate in the modeling effort, and another critical challenge in resolving conflicting (parts of) models and integration of submodels or models from different perspectives. The overview of challenges presented in this paper will inspire the design of methods and support systems that will ultimately advance the efficiency and effectiveness of collaborative modeling tasks.",2014,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846871,"Michiel Renger, Gwendolyn L.

6,Data sets and data quality in software engineering,"OBJECTIVE - to assess the extent and types of techniques used to manage quality within software engineering data sets. We consider this a particularly interesting question in the context of initiatives to promote sharing and secondary analysis of data sets. METHOD - we perform a systematic review of available empirical software engineering studies. RESULTS - only 23 out of the many hundreds of studies assessed, explicitly considered data quality. CONCLUSIONS - first, the community needs to consider the quality and appropriateness of the data set being utilised; not all data sets are equal. Second, we need more research into means of identifying, and ideally repairing, noisy cases. Third, it should become routine to use sensitivity analysis to assess conclusion stability with respect to the assumptions that must be made concerning noise levels.",2005,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1541819,"Gernot A.

7,Developing Open Source Software: A Community-Based Analysis of Research,"Open source software (OSS) creates the potential for the inclusion of large and diverse communities in every aspect of the software development and consumption life cycle. However, despite 6 years of effort by an ever growing research community, we still donÂt know exactly what we do and donÂt know about OSS, nor do we have a clear idea about the basis for our knowledge. This paper presents an analysis of 155 research artefacts in the area of open source software. The purpose of the study is to identify the kinds of open source project communities that have been researched, the kinds of research questions that have been asked, and the methodologies used by researchers. Emerging from the study is a clearer understanding of what we do and donÂt know about open source software, and recommendations for future research efforts ",2015,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7449480,"Joseph Feller, Patrick Finnegan, David Kelly and Maurice MacNamara","Book Series IFIP International Federation for Information Processing, Volume 208/2006, Book Social Inclusion: Societal and Organizational Implications for Information Systems, Pages 261-278, SpringerLink Date Wednesday, September 13, 2006",1
8,Effectiveness of Requirements Elicitation Techniques: Empirical Results Derived from a Systematic Review,"This paper reports a systematic review of empirical studies concerning the effectiveness of elicitation techniques, and the subsequent aggregation of empirical evidence gathered from those studies. The most significant results of the aggregation process are as follows: (I) interviews, preferentially structured, appear to be one of the most effective elicitation techniques; (2) many techniques often cited in the literature, like card sorting, ranking or thinking aloud, tend to be less effective than interviews; (3) analyst experience does not appear to be a relevant factor; and (4) the studies conducted have not found the use of intermediate representations during elicitation to have significant positive effects. It should be noted that, as a general rule, the studies from which these results were aggregated have not been replicated, and therefore the above claims cannot be said to be absolutely certain. However, they can be used by researchers as pieces of knowledge to be further investigated and by practitioners in development projects, always taking into account that they are preliminary findings",2006,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704061,"By Alan Davis , Oscar Dieste , Ann Hickey , Natalia Juristo , Ana M.

9,Evidence-Based Guidelines for Assessment of Software Development Cost Uncertainty,"Several studies suggest that uncertainty assessments of software development costs are strongly biased toward overconfidence, i.e., that software cost estimates typically are believed to be more accurate than they really are. This overconfidence may lead to poor project planning. As a means of improving cost uncertainty assessments, we provide evidence-based guidelines for how to assess software development cost uncertainty, based on results from relevant empirical studies. The general guidelines provided are: 1) Do not rely solely on unaided, intuition-based uncertainty assessment processes, 2) do not replace expert judgment with formal uncertainty assessment models, 3) apply structured and explicit judgment-based processes, 4) apply strategies based on an outside view of the project, 5) combine uncertainty assessments from different sources through group work, not through mechanical combination, 6) use motivational mechanisms with care and only if greater effort is likely to lead to improved assessments, and 7) frame the assessment problem to fit the structure of the relevant uncertainty information and the assessment process. These guidelines are preliminary and should be updated in response to new evidence.",2005,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556553,By Magne Jorgensen,"Found in: IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

10,Experimental context classification: incentives and experience of subjects,"There is a need to identify factors that affect the result of empirical studies in software engineering research. It is still the case that seemingly identical replications of controlled experiments result in different conclusions due to the fact that all factors describing the experiment context are not clearly defined and hence controlled. In this article, a scheme for describing the participants of controlled experiments is proposed and evaluated. It consists of two main factors, the incentives for participants in the experiment and the experience of the participants. The scheme has been evaluated by classifying a set of previously conducted experiments from literature. It can be concluded that the scheme was easy to use and understand. It is also found that experiments that are classified in the same way to a large extent point at the same results, which indicates that the scheme addresses relevant factors.",2005,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553590,"Martin H?st, Claes Wohlin, Thomas Thelin","ICSE '05: Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Software engineering, May 2005, Publisher: ACM",1
11,How Does a Measurement Programme Evolve in Software Organizations?,"<p><p>Establishing a software measurement programme within an organization is not a straightforward task. Previous literature surveys have focused on software process improvement in general and software measurement has been analysed in case studies. This literature survey collects the data from separate cases and presents the critical success factors that are specific to software measurement programmes. We present a categorization of the success factors based on organizational roles that are involved in measurement. Furthermore, the most essential elements of success in different phases of the life cycle of the measurement programme are analysed. It seems that the role of upper management is crucial when starting measurement and the individual developers' impact increases in the later phases. Utilization of the measurement data and improvement of the measurement and development processes requires active management support again.</p></p>",2008,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1425920&CFID=932207713&CFTOKEN=72281918,"Lasse Harjumaa, Jouni Markkula and Markku Oivo","Book Series Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 5089/2008, Book Product-Focused Software Process Improvement, Pages 230-243, SpringerLink Date Tuesday, June 17, 2008",1
13,In search of `architectural knowledge',"The software architecture community puts more and more emphasis on 'architectural knowledge'. However, there appears to be no commonly accepted definition of what architectural knowledge entails, which makes it a fuzzy concept. In order to obtain a better understanding of how different authors view 'architectural knowledge', we have conducted a systematic review to examine how architectural knowledge is defined and how the different definitions in use are related. From this review it became clear that many authors do not provide a concrete definition of what they think architectural knowledge entails. What is more intriguing, though, is that those who do give a definition seem to agree that architectural knowledge spans from problem domain through decision making to solution; an agreement that is not obvious from the definitions themselves, but which is only brought to light after careful systematic comparison of the different studies.",2010,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5659173,"Remco C. de Boer, Rik Farenhorst","SHARK '08: Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Sharing and reusing architectural knowledge, May 2008 , Publisher: ACM",1
14,Measurement in software engineering: From the roadmap to the crossroads.,"Research on software measurement can be organized around five key conceptual and methodological issues: how to apply measurement theory to software, how to frame software metrics, how to develop metrics, how to collect core measures, and how to analyze measures. The subject is of special concern for the industry, which is interested in improving practices - mainly in developing countries, where the software industry represents an opportunity for growth and usually receives institutional support for matching international quality standards. Academics are also in need of understanding and developing more effective methods for managing the software process and assessing the success of products and services, as a result of an enhanced awareness about the emergency of aligning business processes and information systems. This paper unveils the fundamentals of measurement in software engineering and discusses current issues and foreseeable trends for the subject. A literature review was performed within major academic publications in the last decade, and findings suggest a sensible shift of measurement interests towards managing the software process as a whole - without losing from sight the customary focus on hard issues like algorithm efficiency and worker productivity",1997,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=585509,"C.

The contributions are categorized according to a simple conceptual framework. The framework comprises four perspectives: the requirements perspective, the technology perspective, the application perspective, and the business perspective. Our literature review shows that mobile systems development is overlooked in the current debate. From the review, we extend the traditional view on systems development to encompass mobile systems and, based on the identified perspectives, we propose core characteristics for mobile systems. We also extend the traditional focus found in systems development on processes in a development project to encompass the whole of the development company as well as interorganizational linkage between development companies. Finally, we point at research directions emerging from the review that are relevant to the field of mobile systems development.",1989,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=198939,Jens Henrik Hosbond and Peter Axel Nielsen,"Book Series IFIP International Federation for Information Processing, Volume 185/2005, Book Designing Ubiquitous Information Environments: Socio-Technical Issues and Challenges, Pages 215-232, SpringerLink Date Thursday, February 09, 2006",1
16,"Quality, productivity and economic benefits of software reuse: a review of industrial studies","<p>Systematic software reuse is proposed to increase productivity and software quality and lead to economic benefits. Reports of successful software reuse programs in industry have been published. However, there has been little effort to organize the evidence systematically and appraise it. This review aims to assess the effects of software reuse in industrial contexts. Journals and major conferences between 1994 and 2005 were searched to find observational studies and experiments conducted in industry, returning eleven papers of observational type. Systematic software reuse is significantly related to lower problem (defect, fault or error) density in five studies and to decreased effort spent on correcting problems in three studies. The review found evidence for significant gains in apparent productivity in three studies. Other significant benefits of software reuse were reported in single studies or the results were inconsistent. Evidence from industry is sparse and combining results was done by vote-counting. Researchers should pay more attention to using comparable metrics, performing longitudinal studies, and explaining the results and impact on industry. For industry, evaluating reuse of COTS or OSS components, integrating reuse activities in software processes, better data collection and evaluating return on investment are major challenges.</p>",2007,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1290919&CFID=932217338&CFTOKEN=19657119,"Parastoo Mohagheghi, Reidar Conradi","Empirical Software Engineering,   Volume 12 Issue 5, October 2007, Empirical Software Engineering,   Volume 12 Issue 5, October 2007, Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers",1
17,Reflections on 10 Years of Software Process Simulation Modeling,"Software process simulation modeling (SPSM) has become an increasingly active research area since its introduction in the late 1980s. Particularly during the last ten years the related research community and the number of publications have been growing. The objective of this research is to provide insights about the evolution of SPSM research during the last 10 years. A systematic literature review was proposed with two subsequent stages to achieve this goal. This paper presents the preliminary results of the first stage of the review that is exclusively focusing on a core set of publication sources. More than 200 relevant publications were analyzed in order to find answers to the research questions, including the purposes and scopes of SPSM, application domains, and predominant research issues. From the analysis the following conclusions could be drawn: (1) Categories for classifying software process simulation models as suggested by the authors of a landmark publication in 1999 should be adjusted and refined to better capture the diversity of published models. (2) Research improving the efficiency of SPSM is gaining importance. (3) Hybrid process simulation models have attracted interest as a possibility to more realistically capture complex real-world software processes.

18,Software process improvement in small and medium software enterprises: a systematic review,"Small and medium enterprises are a very important cog in the gears of the world economy. The software industry in most countries is composed of an industrial scheme that is made up mainly of small and medium software enterprises--SMEs. To strengthen these types of organizations, efficient Software Engineering practices are needed--practices which have been adapted to their size and type of business. Over the last two decades, the Software Engineering community has expressed special interest in software process improvement (SPI) in an effort to increase software product quality, as well as the productivity of software development. However, there is a widespread tendency to make a point of stressing that the success of SPI is only possible for large companies. In this article, a systematic review of published case studies on the SPI efforts carried out in SMEs is presented. Its objective is to analyse the existing approaches towards SPI which focus on SMEs and which report a case study carried out in industry. A further objective is that of discussing the significant issues related to this area of knowledge, and to provide an up-to-date state of the art, from which innovative research activities can be thought of and planned.",2011,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6083172,"Francisco J.

19,Software project economics: a roadmap,"The objective of this paper is to consider research progress in the field of software project economics with a view to identifying important challenges and promising research directions. I argue that this is an important sub-discipline since this will underpin any cost-benefit analysis used to justify the resourcing, or otherwise, of a software project. To accomplish this I conducted a bibliometric analysis of peer reviewed research articles to identify major areas of activity. My results indicate that the primary goal of more accurate cost prediction systems remains largely unachieved. However, there are a number of new and promising avenues of research including: how we can combine results from primary studies, integration of multiple predictions and applying greater emphasis upon the human aspects of prediction tasks. I conclude that the field is likely to remain very challenging due to the people-centric nature of software engineering, since it is in essence a design task. Nevertheless the need for good economic models will grow rather than diminish as software becomes increasingly ubiquitous.",2007,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221628,Martin Shepperd,"FOSE '07: 2007 Future of Software Engineering , May 2007",1
20,Status of Empirical Research in Software Engineering,"We provide an assessment of the status of empirical software research by analyzing all refereed articles that appeared in the Journal of Empirical Software Engineering from its first issue in January 1996 through June 2006. The journal publishes empirical software research exclusively and it is the only journal to do so. The main findings are: 1. The dominant empirical methods are experiments and case studies. Other methods (correlational studies, meta analysis, surveys, descriptive approaches, ex post facto studies) occur infrequently; long-term studies are missing. About a quarter of the experiments are replications. 2. Professionals are used somewhat more frequently than students as subjects. 3. The dominant topics studied are measurement/metrics and tools/methods/frameworks. Metrics research is dominated by correlational and case studies without any experiments. 4. Important topics are underrepresented or absent, for example: programming languages, model driven development, formal methods, and others. The narrow focus on a few empirically researched topics is in contrast to the broad scope of software research.

21,Systematic review of organizational motivations for adopting CMM-based SPI,"Background: Software Process Improvement (SPI) is intended to improve software engineering, but can only be effective if used. To improve SPI's uptake, we should understand why organizations adopt SPI. CMM-based SPI approaches are widely known and studied. Objective: We investigated why organizations adopt CMM-based SPI approaches, and how these motivations relate to organizations' size. Method: We performed a systematic review, examining reasons reported in more than forty primary studies. Results: Reasons usually related to product quality and project performance, and less commonly, to process. Organizations reported customer reasons infrequently and employee reasons very rarely. We could not show that reasons related to size. Conclusion: Despite its origins in helping to address customer-related issues for the USAF, CMM-based SPI has mostly been adopted to help organizations improve project performance and product quality issues. This reinforces a view that the goal of SPI is not to improve process per se, but instead to provide business benefits.",2008,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1365278&CFID=932221225&CFTOKEN=61415952,M.

Conclusions drawn from hypothesis testing results might be erroneous if effect sizes are not judged in addition to statistical significance. This paper reports a systematic review of 92 controlled experiments published in 12 major software engineering journals and conference proceedings in the decade 1993-2002. The review investigates the practice of effect size reporting, summarizes standardized effect sizes detected in the experiments, discusses the results and gives advice for improvements. Standardized and/or unstandardized effect sizes were reported in 29% of the experiments. Interpretations of the effect sizes in terms of practical importance were not discussed beyond references to standard conventions. The standardized effect sizes computed from the reviewed experiments were equal to observations in psychology studies and slightly larger than standard conventions in behavioral science.

23,Tailoring and Introduction of the Rational Unified Process,RUP is a comprehensive software development process framework that has gained a lot of interest by the industry. One major challenge of taking RUP into use is to tailor it to specific needs and then to introduce it into a development organization. This study presents a review and a systematic assembly of existing studies on the tailoring and introduction of RUP. From a systematic search for study reports on this topic we found that most research is anecdotal and focus on the effects of RUP itself. Only a few number of studies address tailoring and introduction. We have found that tailoring RUP is a considerable challenge by itself and that it must be closely related to existing best practices. We see a tendency of turning from large complete process frameworks towards smaller and more light-weight processes which may impose a smoother transition from process model to process in use. ,2009,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362562,"Geir Kjetil Hanssen, Finn Olav Bj?rnson and Hans Westerheim","Book Series Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Publisher Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, Volume 4764/2007, Book Software Process Improvement, Pages 7-18, SpringerLink Date Thursday, September 13, 2007",1

The survey was carried out applying systematic review principles during the literature review. The results include analysis obtained from the synthesis of 53 studies, selected from an initial set of 844.

25,The Role of Deliberate Artificial Design Elements in Software Engineering Experiments,"Increased realism in software engineering experiments is often promoted as an important means of increasing generalizability and industrial relevance. In this context, artificiality, e.g., the use of constructed tasks in place of realistic tasks, is seen as a threat. In this paper, we examine the opposite view that deliberately introduced artificial design elements may increase knowledge gain and enhance both generalizability and relevance. In the first part of this paper, we identify and evaluate arguments and examples in favor of and against deliberately introducing artificiality into software engineering experiments. We find that there are good arguments in favor of deliberately introducing artificial design elements to 1) isolate basic mechanisms, 2) establish the existence of phenomena, 3) enable generalization from particularly unfavorable to more favorable conditions (persistence of phenomena), and 4) relate experiments to theory. In the second part of this paper, we summarize a content analysis of articles that report software engineering experiments published over a 10-year period from 1993 to 2002. The analysis reveals a striving for realism and external validity, but little awareness of for what and when various degrees of artificiality and realism are appropriate. Furthermore, much of the focus on realism seems to be based on a narrow understanding of the nature of generalization. We conclude that an increased awareness and deliberation as to when and for what purposes both artificial and realistic design elements are applied is valuable for better knowledge gain and quality in empirical software engineering experiments. We also conclude that time spent on studies that have obvious threats to validity that are due to artificiality might be better spent on studies that investigate research questions for which artificiality is a strength rather than a weakness. However, arguments in favor of artificial design elements should not be used to justify studies - - that are badly designed or that have research questions of low relevance.",2008,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4453833,"By Jo Hannay , Magne J?rgensen","Found in: IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

28,Cross versus Within-Company Cost Estimation Studies: A Systematic Review,"The objective of this paper is to determine under what circumstances individual organizations would be able to rely on cross-company-based estimation models. We performed a systematic review of studies that compared predictions from cross-company models with predictions from within-company models based on analysis of project data. Ten papers compared cross-company and within-company estimation models; however, only seven presented independent results. Of those seven, three found that cross-company models were not significantly different from within-company models, and four found that cross-company models were significantly worse than within-company models. Experimental procedures used by the studies differed making it impossible to undertake formal meta-analysis of the results. The main trend distinguishing study results was that studies with small within-company data sets (i.e., $20 projects) that used leave-one-out cross validation all found that the within-company model was significantly different (better) from the cross-company model. The results of this review are inconclusive. It is clear that some organizations would be ill-served by cross-company models whereas others would benefit. Further studies are needed, but they must be independent (i.e., based on different data bases or at least different single company data sets) and should address specific hypotheses concerning the conditions that would favor cross-company or within-company models. In addition, experimenters need to standardize their experimental procedures to enable formal meta-analysis, and recommendations are made in Section 3.",2007,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4160970/,"By Barbara A.

29,A Systematic Review of Software Development Cost Estimation Studies,"This paper aims to provide a basis for the improvement of software-estimation research through a systematic review of previous work. The review identifies 304 software cost estimation papers in 76 journals and classifies the papers according to research topic, estimation approach, research approach, study context and data set. A Web-based library of these cost estimation papers is provided to ease the identification of relevant estimation research results. The review results combined with other knowledge provide support for recommendations for future software cost estimation research, including: 1) increase the breadth of the search for relevant studies, 2) search manually for relevant papers within a carefully selected set of journals when completeness is essential, 3) conduct more studies on estimation methods commonly used by the software industry, and 4) increase the awareness of how properties of the data sets impact the results when evaluating estimation methods",2007,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4027147/,"By Magne Jorgensen , Martin Shepperd","Found in: IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering ,Issue Date:January 2007

30,A Survey of Controlled Experiments in Software Engineering,"The classical method for identifying cause-effect relationships is to conduct controlled experiments. This paper reports upon the present state of how controlled experiments in software engineering are conducted and the extent to which relevant information is reported. Among the 5,453 scientific articles published in 12 leading software engineering journals and conferences in the decade from 1993 to 2002, 103 articles (1.9 percent) reported controlled experiments in which individuals or teams performed one or more software engineering tasks. This survey quantitatively characterizes the topics of the experiments and their subjects (number of subjects, students versus professionals, recruitment, and rewards for participation), tasks (type of task, duration, and type and size of application) and environments (location, development tools). Furthermore, the survey reports on how internal and external validity is addressed and the extent to which experiments are replicated. The gathered data reflects the relevance of software engineering experiments to industrial practice and the scientific maturity of software engineering research.",2005,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1514443/,"By Dag I.K.

31,A Survey on Software Estimation in the Norwegian Industry,"Abstract:
We provide an overview of the estimation methods that software companies apply to estimate their projects, why those methods are chosen, and how accurate they are. In order to improve estimation accuracy, such knowledge is essential. We conducted an in-depth survey, where information was collected through structured interviews with senior managers from 18 different companies and project managers of 52 different projects. We analyzed information about estimation approach, effort estimation accuracy and bias, schedule estimation accuracy and bias, delivered functionality and other estimation related information. Our results suggest, for example, that average effort overruns are 41%, that the estimation performance has not changed much the last 10-20 years, that expert estimation is the dominating estimation method, that estimation accuracy is not much impacted by use of formal estimation models, and that software managers tend to believe that the estimation accuracy of their company is better than it actually is.",2004,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1357904/,"By Kjetil Molokken-Ostvold , Magne Jorgensen , Sinan S.

32,A Systematic Review of Theory Use in Software Engineering Experiments,"Empirically based theories are generally perceived as foundational to science. However, in many disciplines, the nature, role and even the necessity of theories remain matters for debate, particularly in young or practical disciplines such as software engineering. This article reports a systematic review of the explicit use of theory in a comprehensive set of 103 articles reporting experiments, from of a total of 5,453 articles published in major software engineering journals and conferences in the decade 1993-2002. Of the 103 articles, 24 use a total of 40 theories in various ways to explain the cause-effect relationship(s) under investigation. The majority of these use theory in the experimental design to justify research questions and hypotheses, some use theory to provide post hoc explanations of their results, and a few test or modify theory. A third of the theories are proposed by authors of the reviewed articles. The interdisciplinary nature of the theories used is greater than that of research in software engineering in general. We found that theory use and awareness of theoretical issues are present, but that theory-driven research is, as yet, not a major issue in empirical software engineering. Several articles comment explicitly on the lack of relevant theory. We call for an increased awareness of the potential benefits of involving theory, when feasible. To support software engineering researchers who wish to use theory, we show which of the reviewed articles on which topics use which theories for what purposes, as well as details of the theories' characteristics",2007,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4052585/,"By Jo E.

34,Are Two Heads Better than One? On the Effectiveness of Pair Programming,"Pair programming is a collaborative approach that makes working in pairs rather than individually the primary work style for code development. Because PP is a radically different approach than many developers are used to, it can be hard to predict the effects when a team switches to PP. Because projects focus on different things, this article concentrates on understanding general aspects related to effectiveness, specifically project duration, effort, and quality. Not unexpectedly, our meta-analysis showed that the question of whether two heads are better than one isn't precise enough to be meaningful. Given the evidence, the best answer is ""it depends"" - on both the programmer's expertise and the complexity of the system and tasks to be solved. Two heads are better than one for achieving correctness on highly complex programming tasks. They might also have a time gain on simpler tasks. Additional studies would be useful. For example, further investigation is clearly needed into the interaction of complexity and programmer experience and how they affect the appropriateness of a PP approach; our current understanding of this phenomenon rests chiefly on a single (although large) study. Only by understanding what makes pairs work and what makes them less efficient can we take steps to provide beneficial work conditions, to avoid detrimental conditions, and to avoid pairing altogether when conditions are detrimental. With the right cooks and the right combination of ingredients, the broth has the potential to be very good indeed.",2007,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375233,"By Tore Dyb? , Erik Arisholm , Dag I.K.

35,Do SQA Programs Work - CMM Works. A Meta Analysis,"Many software development professionals and managers of software development organizations are not fully convinced in the profitability of investments for the advancement of SQA systems. The results included in each of the articles we found, cannot lead to general conclusions on the impact of investments in upgrading an SQA system. Our meta analysis was based on CMM level transition (CMMLT) analysis of available publications and was for the seven most common performance metric. The CMMLT analysis is applicable for combined analysis of empirical data from many sources. Each record in our meta analysis database is calculated as ""after-before ratio"", which is nearly free of the studied organization's characteristics. Because the CMM guidelines and SQA requirement are similar, we claim that the results for CMM programs are also applicable to investments in SQA systems. The extensive database of over 1,800 projects from a variety of 19 information sources leading to the meta analysis results - proved that investments in CMM programs and similarly in SQA systems contribute to software development performance.",2005,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1421069,"By Daniel Galin , Moti Avrahami","Found in: IEEE International Conference on Software - Science, Technology & Engineering (SwSTE'05)

37,"Capture-recapture in software inspections after 10 years research - theory, evaluation and application.","Software inspection is a method to detect faults in the early phases of the software life cycle. In order to estimate the number of faults?not?found, capture?recapture was introduced for software inspections in 1992 to estimate remaining faults after an inspection. Since then, several papers have been written in the area, concerning the basic theory, evaluation of models and application of the method. This paper summarizes the work made in capture?recapture for software inspections during these years. Furthermore, and more importantly, the contribution of the papers are classified as?theory,?evaluation?or?application, in order to analyse the performed research as well as to highlight the areas of research that need further work. It is concluded that (1) most of the basic theory is investigated within biostatistics, (2) most software engineering research is performed on evaluation, a majority ending up in recommendation of the Mh?JK model, and (3) there is a need for application experiences. In order to support the application, an inspection process is presented with decision points based on capture?recapture estimates.",2004,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121203000906,"H.

38,A systematic review of statistical power in software engineering experiments.,"Statistical power is an inherent part of empirical studies that employ significance testing and is essential for the planning of studies, for the interpretation of study results, and for the validity of study conclusions. This paper reports a quantitative assessment of the statistical power of empirical software engineering research based on the 103 papers on controlled experiments (of a total of 5,453 papers) published in nine major software engineering journals and three conference proceedings in the decade 1993Â2002. The results show that the statistical power of software engineering experiments falls substantially below accepted norms as well as the levels found in the related discipline of information systems research. Given this study's findings, additional attention must be directed to the adequacy of sample sizes and research designs to ensure acceptable levels of statistical power. Furthermore, the current reporting of significance tests should be enhanced by also reporting effect sizes and confidence intervals.",2007,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4052585,"T.

39,Software effort estimation terminology: The tower of Babel.,"It is well documented that the software industry suffers from frequent cost overruns. A contributing factor is, we believe, the imprecise estimation terminology in use. A lack of clarity and precision in the use of estimation terms reduces the interpretability of estimation accuracy results, makes the communication of estimates difficult, and lowers the learning possibilities. This paper reports on a structured review of typical software effort estimation terminology in software engineering textbooks and software estimation research papers. The review provides evidence that the term ?effort estimate? is frequently used without sufficient clarification of its meaning, and that estimation accuracy is often evaluated without ensuring that the estimated and the actual effort are comparable. Guidelines are suggested on how to reduce this lack of clarity and precision in terminology.",2006,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584905000674,"S. Grimstad, M.

40,In Search of What We Experimentally Know about Unit Testing,"Gathering evidence in any discipline is a lengthy procedure, requiring experimentation and empirical confirmation to transform information from mere opinion to undisputed fact. Software engineering is a relatively young field and experimental SE is even younger, so undisputed facts are few and far between. Nevertheless, ESE's relevance is growing because experimental results can help practitioners make better decisions. We have aggregated results from unit-testing experiments with the aim of identifying information with some experimental basis that might help practitioners make decisions. Most of the experiments focus on two important characteristics of testing techniques: effectiveness and efficiency. Some other experiments study the quality of test-case sets according to different criteria",2006,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4012628,"By Natalia Juristo , Ana M.

We present a general approach for identifying side-effect-free methods in Java software. Our technique is parameterized by class analysis and is designed to work on incomplete programs. We present empirical results from two instantiations of the approach, based on rapid type analysis and on points-to analysis. In our experiments with several components, on average 22% of the investigated methods were identified as free of side effects. We also present a precision evaluation which shows that the approach achieves almost perfect precision - i.e., it almost never misses methods that in reality have no side effects. These results indicate that very precise identification of side-effect-free methods is possible with simple and inexpensive analysis techniques, and therefore can be easily incorporated in software tools.",2004,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357793,By Atanas Rountev,"Found in: 20th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM'04)

42,Reviewing 25 Years of Testing Technique Experiments,"Mature knowledge allows engineering disciplines the achievement of predictable results. Unfortunately, the type of knowledge used in software engineering can be considered to be of a relatively low maturity, and developers are guided by intuition, fashion or market-speak rather than by facts or undisputed statements proper to an engineering discipline. Testing techniques determine different criteria for selecting the test cases that will be used as input to the system under examination, which means that an effective and efficient selection of test cases conditions the success of the tests. The knowledge for selecting testing techniques should come from studies that empirically justify the benefits and application conditions of the different techniques. This paper analyzes the maturity level of the knowledge about testing techniques by examining existing empirical studies about these techniques. We have analyzed their results, and obtained a testing technique knowledge classification based on their factuality and objectivity, according to four parameters.",2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FB%3AEMSE.0000013513.48963.1b?LI=true,"Natalia Juristo, Ana M.

Evidence-based software engineering can help software practitioners decide which methods to use and for what purpose. EBSE involves defining relevant questions, surveying and appraising avail able empirical evidence, and integrating and evaluating new practices in the target environment. This article helps define questions regarding defect detection techniques and presents a survey of empirical studies on testing and inspection techniques. We then interpret the findings in terms of practical use. The term defect always relates to one or more underlying faults in an artifact such as code.

We present quantitative and qualitative results of a quasi-random experiment of empirical evaluations over the lifetime of the conference.
