Healthcare systems are among these applications that have been revolutionized with IoT, introducing an IoT branch known as the Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT) systems. IoMT systems allow remote monitoring of patients with chronic diseases. Thus, it can provide timely patients' diagnostic that can save their life in case of emergencies. However, security in these critical systems is a major challenge facing their wide utilization. In this article, we present state-of-the-art techniques to secure IoMT systems' data during collection, transmission, and storage. We comprehensively overview IoMT systems' potential attacks, including physical and network attacks. Our findings reveal that most security techniques do not consider various types of attacks.

3,2017,Clustered Data Collection for Internet of Batteryless Things,"Ju, QA; Zhang, Y","Empowered by energy harvesting technology, Internet of Batteryless Things (IoBT) is considered to be a promising solution for the lifetime constraint of Internet of Things. The varying ambient energy source makes it nontrivial for multiple IoBT nodes to work collaboratively and achieve high-throughput data collection. In this paper, we propose a novel clustered data collection framework for IoBT networks, combining cluster head (CH) selection and lexicographic rate assignment. Using the remaining energy level of the energy storage device as the energy budget, the proposed framework assigns a lexicographic optimal rate vector that enables each IoBT node to fully utilize the scavenged energy and at the same time achieve high and fair data collection rate. Two CH selection schemes are developed. One is optimal CH selection by traversing all the possible CH candidates in the cluster. The other is an approximation search based on the inherent energy consumption features of the lexicographic optimal rate assignment. The real world energy harvesting profile is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Compared with the existing strategies, the proposed framework achieves higher throughput over all range of the data aggregation ratio. The simulation results also demonstrate that the approximation-based CH selection scheme has similar data collection rate performance as that of the optimal CH selection scheme at a much lower computational cost.",1,1,1,"In this paper, we propose a novel clustered data collection framework for IoBT networks, combining cluster head (CH) selection and lexicographic rate assignment.Using the remaining energy level of the energy storage device as the energy budget, the proposed framework assigns a lexicographic optimal rate vector that enables each IoBT node to fully utilize the scavenged energy and at the same time achieve high and fair data collection rate.The real world energy harvesting profile is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.Compared with the existing strategies, the proposed framework achieves higher throughput over all range of the data aggregation ratio.","Using the remaining energy level of the energy storage device as the energy budget, the proposed framework assigns a lexicographic optimal rate vector that enables each IoBT node to fully utilize the scavenged energy and at the same time achieve high and fair data collection rate.The real world energy harvesting profile is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",The simulation results also demonstrate that the approximation-based CH selection scheme has similar data collection rate performance as that of the optimal CH selection scheme at a much lower computational cost.

14,2016,Searching the Social Internet of Things by Exploiting Object Similarity,"Nitti, M; Pilloni, V; Giusto, DD","One of the major issues of Internet of Things (IoT) is discovering which objects are able to execute specific services and provide the required data for applications to be correctly accomplished. In recent years, the Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm, where objects establish social-like relationships, has become popular as it presents several interesting features to improve network navigability and implement efficient discovery methods. This is due to the intrinsic capability of a SIoT network to come to a solution for a query and quickly reach the required object with a small number of hops, using object friendships. In this paper, a SIoT-based object discovery mechanism is proposed. The novelty of this algorithm is that the next hop to query is chosen based on two properties: one that is intrinsic to the network and is based on object friendships, and an external one that takes into account the similarity between the object and the query. Simulation results prove that a correct balance between the two introduced properties is needed and that the proposed algorithm is able to efficiently solve queries, independently of their popularity and complexity.",1,1,1,"In this paper, a SIoT-based object discovery mechanism is proposed.Simulation results prove that a correct balance between the two introduced properties is needed and that the proposed algorithm is able to efficiently solve queries, independently of their popularity and complexity.","In recent years, the Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm, where objects establish social-like relationships, has become popular as it presents several interesting features to improve network navigability and implement efficient discovery methods.This is due to the intrinsic capability of a SIoT network to come to a solution for a query and quickly reach the required object with a small number of hops, using object friendships.","Simulation results prove that a correct balance between the two introduced properties is needed and that the proposed algorithm is able to efficiently solve queries, independently of their popularity and complexity."

88,2018,Dynamic Connectivity Game for Adversarial Internet of Battlefield Things Systems,"Abuzainab, N; Saad, W","In this paper, the problem of network connectivity is studied for an adversarial Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system in which an attacker aims at disrupting the connectivity of the network by choosing to compromise one of the IoBT nodes at each time epoch. To counter such attacks, an IoBT defender attempts to reestablish the IoBT connectivity by either deploying new IoBT nodes or by changing the roles of existing nodes. This problem is formulated as a dynamic multistage Stackelberg connectivity game that extends classical connectivity games and that explicitly takes into account the characteristics and requirements of the IoBT network. In particular, the defender's payoff captures the IoBT latency as well as the sum of weights of disconnected nodes at each stage of the game. Due to the dependence of the attacker's and defender's actions at each stage of the game on the network state, the feedback Stackelberg solution [feedback Stackelberg equilibrium (FSE)] is used to solve the IoBT connectivity game. Then, sufficient conditions under which the IoBT system will remain connected, when the FSE solution is used, are determined analytically. Numerical results show that the expected number of disconnected sensors, when the FSE solution is used, decreases up to 46% compared to a baseline scenario in which a Stackelberg game with no feedback is used, and up to 43% compared to a baseline equal probability policy.",1,1,1,,"Due to the dependence of the attacker's and defender's actions at each stage of the game on the network state, the feedback Stackelberg solution [feedback Stackelberg equilibrium (FSE)] is used to solve the IoBT connectivity game.Then, sufficient conditions under which the IoBT system will remain connected, when the FSE solution is used, are determined analytically.Numerical results show that the expected number of disconnected sensors, when the FSE solution is used, decreases up to 46% compared to a baseline scenario in which a Stackelberg game with no feedback is used, and up to 43% compared to a baseline equal probability policy.Numerical results show that the expected number of disconnected sensors, when the FSE solution is used, decreases up to 46% compared to a baseline scenario in which a Stackelberg game with no feedback is used, and up to 43% compared to a baseline equal probability policy.","Numerical results show that the expected number of disconnected sensors, when the FSE solution is used, decreases up to 46% compared to a baseline scenario in which a Stackelberg game with no feedback is used, and up to 43% compared to a baseline equal probability policy."

103,2019,TinyIKE: Lightweight IKEv2 for Internet of Things,"Raza, S; Magnusson, RM","There is unanimous consensus that cyber security in the Internet of Things (IoT) is necessary. In cyber security, key establishment is one of the toughest problems. It is even more challenging in resource-constrained but Internet-connected IoT devices that use low-power wireless communication. A number of IoT communication protocols define cryptographic mechanisms for confidentiality and integrity services but do not specify key management. For example, IEEE 802.15.4, RPL, and object security all rely on external key management protocols. Due to the lack of automatic key management support, IoT devices either end up using preshared keys or no security at all. In this paper, we overcome these challenges and present TinyIKE, a lightweight adaptation of Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) for the IoT. Using TinyIKE, we solve the key establishment problem for multiple IoT protocols using a single IKEv2-based solution. We implement TinyIKE for resource-constrained IoT devices that run the Contiki OS. The TinyIKE implementation supports full certificate-based IKEv2 that uses elliptic curve cryptography.

Different from existing ICN-based architectures, we take the sharing nature of data-centric services under the IoT into consideration and introduce logically and physically formed communities as the basic building blocks to construct the network so that data could be more efficiently shared and disseminated among interested users.

143,2019,On Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Learning for Internet-of-Things Objects,"Jiang, LS; Tan, R; Lou, X; Lin, GS","The Internet of Things (IoT) will be a main data generation infrastructure for achieving better system intelligence. This paper considers the design and implementation of a practical privacy-preserving collaborative learning scheme, inwhich a curious learning coordinator trains a better machine learning model based on the data samples contributed by a number of IoT objects, while the confidentiality of the raw forms of the training data is protected against the coordinator. Existing distributed machine learning and data encryption approaches incur significant computation and communication overhead, rendering themill-suited for resource-constrained IoT objects. We study an approach that applies independent Gaussian random projection at each IoT object to obfuscate data and trains a deep neural network at the coordinator based on the projected data from the IoT objects. This approach introduces light computation overhead to the IoT objects and moves most workload to the coordinator that can have suficient computing resources. Although the independent projections performed by the IoT objects address the potential collusion between the curious coordinator and some compromised IoT objects, they significantly increase the complexity of the projected data. In this paper, we leverage the superior learning capability of deep learning in capturing sophisticated patterns to maintain good learning performance. Extensive comparative evaluation shows that this approach outperforms other lightweight approaches that apply additive noisification for difierential privacy and/or support vector machines for learning in the applications with light data pattern complexities.",4,1,1,,"Existing distributed machine learning and data encryption approaches incur significant computation and communication overhead, rendering themill-suited for resource-constrained IoT objects.We study an approach that applies independent Gaussian random projection at each IoT object to obfuscate data and trains a deep neural network at the coordinator based on the projected data from the IoT objects.This approach introduces light computation overhead to the IoT objects and moves most workload to the coordinator that can have suficient computing resources.Extensive comparative evaluation shows that this approach outperforms other lightweight approaches that apply additive noisification for difierential privacy and/or support vector machines for learning in the applications with light data pattern complexities.Extensive comparative evaluation shows that this approach outperforms other lightweight approaches that apply additive noisification for difierential privacy and/or support vector machines for learning in the applications with light data pattern complexities.",

Besides its recognized potentialities as a content retrieval solution in wired domains, NDN has been also recently considered as an enabling technology for the Internet of Things (IoT), thanks to its innovative features like named-based routing and in-network caching. In particular, the possibility of caching at intermediate nodes can be especially useful to reduce the retrieval delay, and limit the network traffic and the load on data producer. However, unlike traditional Internet contents, IoT data are typically transient and periodically refreshed by the producer. At the same time, unlike Internet routers, IoT devices can be resource-constrained, with limitations in terms of energy, storage and processing capabilities. Therefore, caching algorithms designed for (intransient) Internet traffic and Internet routers do not well suit IoT domains.
